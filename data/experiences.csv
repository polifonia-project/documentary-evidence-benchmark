The choir (so called) consisted of several men who occupied a square pew in front of the pulpit The first tune was Dr. Arnold’s Wareham, abridged; the second Was French (Dundee), and the third I knew not, but it was unfit for Congregational use, as it went up to G and dwelt there considerably. No small effort was made by good people around me to reach the lofty eminence, but in vain; most voices fell short of the pitch, and vibrations inharmonious followed. The hymn was that beginning,

Jullien was performing a piece entitled Night —I cannot now give the composer’s name. At the beginning the audience was told, either orally or by printed notice, that there might be some startling effects, but no one need be afraid,—all would end well, etc. It is not a difficult task to compose an effective piece to be called Night with the assistance of a grand orchestra as the main factor, and given an opening of quiet, monotonous tones, like Felicien David’s opening to his Desert, a lullaby, a lover’s serenade, and lots of such odds and ends, which any good man with a lively imagination can invent. At the Crystal Palace music of this sort was purring along and lulling people into reposeful security —all quiet as night should ever be—when suddenly the clang of real fire-bells was heard; people jumped from their seats; there was a big commotion ; fire and flames were seen apparently bursting from the roof of the Palace; ushers were rushing about telling people to sit down, for it was a part of the performance; the big doors were swung open, and in rushed two or three fire companies with their “machines,” hose, and great fire-ladders. These ladders were raised to the roof, and the firemen, in their traditional red flannel shirts and helmets, and carrying speaking-trumpets, climbed the ladders. Real water was squirted, glass was broken, cries, orders, every sort of noise concomitant of a fire was heard,—-plus the big orchestra, which was making a fearful din, sawing and blowing fortissimo through every possible diminished seventh that could be raked up out of the musical scale.
It lasted long enough to make the most tremendously red-peppered musical sensation that mortal ears ever heard.
It must be understood that all the previously distributed notices were not sufficient to prevent some timid souls from being alarmed. The noise and confusion created almost a panic. Some were fainting, others bursting with laughter, the cooler ones enthusiastically admiring the well-arranged piece. Finally, the fire was put out, the firemen with their machines retired, and the orchestra artistically prepared the audience for a song of praise and thanksgiving which came in the shape of Old Hundred played and sung, and joined in by the well-pleased audience. It was a ne plus ultra of realistic music",180u-Mm-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/New_York_City,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/0768ec79e9640b943c9f152efe2c52fd/1450198201607,Indoor Accompanied Public,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Thomas+Ryan/1448997315048,Thomas Ryan,Performance,,

On this last day of the year, there was a grand ceremony at the church of the Jesuits;—to sing out the old year—to offer up thanksgivings for all past blessings—and to solicit a renewal of them in the year to come. The crowd was immense, and the ceremony very impressive. There is a principle of equality in Catholic congregations, more consonant with the spirit of that religion which teaches that God is no respecter of persons, than the practice which prevails in our own church;—where the greatest distinction is made between the accommodations of the rich and the poor. The former are carefully separated from the contamination of the latter, into pews […] In the Catholic congregations there are no such invidious distinctions;—the rich and the poor kneel down together, on the same marble floor;—as children of the same Parent—to ask the same blessings, from their common Benefactor. All the congregation joined in the chant of thanksgiving, and I was deeply impressed by the touching solemnity of the ceremony. There is always something affecting in a large concourse of people participating in the same emotion; the feeling is heightened by the contagion of sympathy, and wound up to enthusiasm by the influence of numbers.",http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/day/1817-12-31,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rome,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/ae5132e6b2a8ac82bf25a3f5bd24c374/1518778755263,Indoor Accompanied Public,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Henry+Matthews/1518777337226,Henry Matthews,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Male_vocals http://dbpedia.org/resource/Female_vocals http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/musicgenre/sacred+vocal

The stalls, boxes, and pit were crowded with&nbsp;the elite of Viennese society, fashionable, artistic, and&nbsp;literary...fill[ing] all the ""numbered''&nbsp;seats at the Wieden...&nbsp;whilst the galleries were thronged almost to suffocation by Strauss's most enthusiastic admirers — the true&nbsp;bom Viennese of the lower middle classes. Archduke&nbsp;William — who, being Grand Master of the Order of St.&nbsp;John, seldom shows himself in a theatre — occupied the&nbsp;Imperial Box, whilst King Milan of Servia sate out the&nbsp;whole performance in a ground-tier stage box, signifying&nbsp;his admiration for the bénéficiaire's talents and achievements by conferring upon him, towards the close of the&nbsp;evening, the Cross of the Takovo Order. The progranmie of the occasion consisted of selections from&nbsp;Strauss's operas, conducted by himself. His desk was&nbsp;converted for the nonce into a gorgeous flower-bed of the&nbsp;costliest exotics; and his appearance thereat, baton in&nbsp;hand, was the signal for a demonstration of affectionate&nbsp;rejoicing on the part of the audience, such as, according&nbsp;to the leading journals of the Kaiserstadt, has never&nbsp;before been witnessed within the walls of a Vienna&nbsp;theatre. He opened the entertainment with his bright&nbsp;little overture to Indigo — his first opera, produced at the&nbsp;Wieden Theatre about twenty years ago — which was&nbsp;rapturously re-demanded. Then came the first act of A&nbsp;Night in Venice, followed by the immortal Schoene blaue&nbsp;Donau during the entr'acte, which inimitable waltz&nbsp;brought down a shower of laurel wreaths upon its composer's head. The second act of Fledermaus with some&nbsp;additions to the dialogue written especially for the&nbsp;occasion, came next, and was succeeded by ""musical&nbsp;episodes "" from Spitzentuch, Methusalem, Cagliostro, Der Lustige Krieg and the Carnival in Rome,&nbsp;each successive&nbsp;number being supplemented by presentations of addresses,&nbsp;medals, and flowers.&nbsp;",http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/day/1884-10-15,,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/11022dc1a652ff4a893eb439cdaa3939/1451947174697,Indoor Public Accompanied,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/William+Beatty-Kingston/1444079044346 http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Milian+I+of+Serbia/1451947039739,William Beatty-Kingston Milian I of Serbia,Performance,,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_music

If the interest in Mademoiselle Lind's debut could have been heightened, I should have said that it was increased by the first appearance of the celebrated German bass singer, Staudigl, on the Italian boards, in his famous part of Bertram. His success in this character (for which indeed he had been expressly engaged) was as great as it was merited, although his pronunciation of the Italian language was defective. He was proclaimed the Bertram of the Italian stage, as he had been of the German, Still it was impossible for him to occupy his merited position in the operatic ""talk"" of the day, when the public mind was wholly and exclusively absorbed by one object — Jenny Lind.",1847-uu-uu,,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/b7a3a8bc08cf20995a4d026b4ede75e7/1438703966231,Accompanied Indoor Public,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Benjamin+Lumley/1438607277398 http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Queen+Victoria/1393599242108,Benjamin Lumley Queen Victoria,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

In 1853, Madame Sontag came to Boston with a brilliant company, Carl Eckert being the conductor. When the Sontag party first arrived in America they had with them the fine boy violinist, Paul Jullien. I think he was about fifteen years of age at that time. He played mainly Alard and Leonard pieces, and played them very brilliantly. When the company had made a limited concert tour, attended with indifferent success, it was reorganized into an operatic enterprise and the boy violinist returned to Europe. I think his career was closed by death.
I remember distinctly Sontag in her best role, “ La Fille du Regiment” She was a most attractive picture in her vivandiire costume, with the drum hanging from her neck by a “ sling,” and as she was a good drummer she won enormous success. She was certainly a fine actress and an excellent singer.",1853-uu-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boston,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/afea61052ea7e32c4a8e582ae696cde9/1450273701284,Indoor Accompanied Public,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Thomas+Ryan/1448997315048,Thomas Ryan,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Violin,

I have drawn a deplorable scene descriptive of the hearing of music in private; let me revive a scene, fresh, doubtless, in the memory of many now living, in which the hearing of music in public probably reached its climax. I allude to the production of MENDELSSOHN'S Elijah at the Birmingham festival of 1846, upon which occasion MENDELSSOHN himself wielded the conductor's baton. 
On that memorable August morning in the year 1846 when, punctual to the minute, FELIX MENDELSSOHN stepped into the conductor's seat, and, facing the immense audience assembled in the noble Town Hall of Birmingham, was received with a storm of applause which was taken up and redoubled by the chorus and orchestra how little did that vast audience know that in little more than a year from that time the heart of the great composer would have ceased to beat! That day, we must always think, was the crowning moment of his life, and that great oratorio seems to us the culmination of his mighty musical and dramatic faculty. All those who were present declare that that first public performance was one never to be forgotten the novelty of treatment, the startling effects, the enchanting subjects, the prodigious daring of some of the situations, the heavenly melodies which have since become musical watchwards, and, above all, the presence of the composer, who sent an electric thrill through the room, and inspired chorus, band, and singers with the same lofty enthusiasm which made him so great and irresistible in achievement all this may now, alas, be remembered, but can never be reproduced. It made the hearing of the music of Elijah for the first time a perfectly typical occasion, and one whose conditions, as far as they are realisable, should never cease to be striven after. &nbsp;&nbsp;",1846-uu-uu,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/ffe16c973543df5b004af3c27baaab11,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/33352a2059932c399d494d39648f6d31/1437748141023,Accompanied Public Indoor,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Concert+audience/1437737637011,Concert audience,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oratorio

In his Carnaval de Ventse, he exhibited a mastery over every form of violin technics which quite reached the marvellous. His chromatic scale, played staccato from the lowest to the highest note, and down again to the lowest, in one bow,— either an up or down bow,—was a feat, a tour de force, shown us by no other virtuoso. His double trills and double harmonics were perfect. Nor was it in mere technical playing that he was great, for he played with much sentiment and feeling, and in quartette playing he showed his best quality. He was the master-player and king of all I have heard.

Visited the opera for the first time. Of all the stupid things in the world, a serious opera is perhaps the most stupid, and the opera of to-night [Armida] formed no exception to this observation. The theatre is, I believe, the largest in Europe, and it is certainly too large for the singers, whose voices sound like penny trumpets on Salisbury Plain.*
&nbsp;
* It ought to excite little wonder, that there are so few good singers in Italy; for she is unable, from her poverty, to retain those whom she has herself formed. […] Besides, the Italians of the present day have no taste for the higher kinds of music,—for full and grand harmonies,—or for instrumental music in general. If you talk to them of Haydn, Mozart, or Beethoven, they shrug up their shoulders, and tell you—""&nbsp;E Musica Tedesca,—non ci abbiamo gusto."" Cherubini, their only really great composer, might perhaps be cited as an exception, […] What the Italians like, is an easy flowing melody,&nbsp;unincumbered, as they would call it, with too much harmony. Whatever&nbsp;Corinne&nbsp;may say to the contrary, they seem to have little or no relish for impassioned music.&nbsp;Take an example of the taste of the times from the Opera of to-night—Armida— the composition of their favourite&nbsp;Rossini. His operas are always easy and flowing;—abounding in prettinesses and melting cadenzas, but he never reaches, nor apparently does he attempt to reach, the sustained and elevated character which distinguishes the music of Mozart. But Rossini's works ought not to be too severely criticised; for the continual demand for new music is greater than any fertility of head could supply. The Italians never like to go back;—without referring so far as their own great Corelli—Cimarosa, Paisiello, and others of equally recent date, are already become antiquated; and as Rossini is almost their only composer, he is obliged to write an opera in the interval of a few weeks, between the bringing out of the last, and its being laid on the shelf.
&nbsp;It is a sad tantalizing thing to hear music in Italy which you may wish to carry away with you; for they have no printed music!—This alone is sufficient to indicate the low state of the art. From Naples to Milan, I believe, there is no such artist as an Engraver of Music , and you never see a Music shop. You must therefore go without it, or employ a Copier, whose trade is regulated by the most approved cheating rules. He charges you according to the quantity of paper written on, and therefore takes care not to write too closely.

This same year, by the way, witnessed the brief “Perosi craze”. How that purely artificial vogue ever came to extend beyond the walls of the Italian churches no one knows. At least it should have stopped short at Paris, which was as far as the youthful abbe himself contrived to get on his road to London. But for a time the “craze"" raged in England with the virulence of an epidemic, and many sane musicians persuaded themselves that the new oratorio composer was a genius of the first magnitude. His “Transfiguration"", his “Raising of Lazarus,"" and his “Resurrection of Christ"" were all performed at the London Musical Festival which Robert Newman started at Queen's Hall in May; while his “Passion of Christ"" was given at the Norwich Festival in the autumn. In each instance, however, there was felt a keen sense of disappointment. At best Perosi's works could appeal only to the ear amid ecclesiastical surroundings, and even there their woeful lack of originality was bound to irritate the critical listener.",1899-uu-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Queen's_Hall,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/f9e5766bfe97a3135aaadc1f2c083ad7/1438598912609,Public Accompanied Indoor,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Hermann+Klein/1438157240872,Hermann Klein,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oratorio

One of our violinists was to play a solo on the old French air, “ Je suis le petit tambour."" When the concert was over, my attention was called to this number on the programme, which read, to my horror, “ Jesus le petit tambour.""
At another time, Mr. Schultze was playing nightly the old caprice by Miska Hauser, entitled, The Bird in the Tree. Writing the programme one day in the office of the printer, I incautiously wrote, “ Bird business, Mr. Schultze,” supposing that they would print the full title as usual. The programmes were printed without giving me a chance to read the proof. When we came to that special number, we noticed a peculiar buzz and fun- enjoying condition among our auditors.

The first one, February 3, 1851, given in the Melodeon, was a great success. We invited as guests all our concert subscribers, decorated the hall tastefully, and covered the face of the balcony with white cotton cloth fringed with evergreen, on which, in letters nearly a yard long, was the legend:
“ Born, Feb. 3, 1809. Died in 1847.”
The stage was of course the focus of our efforts. We had borrowed a plaster bust of Mendelssohn, placed it on a pedestal festooned with flowers, and put it at the front-centre of the stage. Our five music-stands were also decorated with flowers. Then we gathered together and played round this representative, so to speak, patronymic saint He was our idol; we offered him our adoration and homage. We were young, and certainly sincere.

Great as was the excitement produced by the Alice of Jenny Lind, it was perhaps exceeded by her next performance. In the part of Amina, in ""La Sonnambula,"" she surpassed all previous expectations.

Not only was she the Sonnamhula, but Amina was generally looked upon as the culminating point of her unprecedently successful season.

The day began with a musical mass, at which the Bishop of Como officiated in pontificalibus; the whole sumptuous parade of the most sumptuous and most attractive of all religions was exhibited; and the same orchestra which performed the ""Cenerentola,"" at the Opera, the night before, and symphonized the triumphs of the Glass Slipper, now with the exact same strains (the brilliant harmonies of Rossini) accompanied the most solemn and imposing ceremonies of the most holy of mysteries.

Song was the dew drops that gathered during the long dark night of despondency, and were sure to glitter in the very first blink of sun […] We had nothing to give but a kind look and a song […] Thinking that the better features of humanity could not be utterly defaced where song and melody were permitted to exist, and that where they were not all crushed, Hope and Mercy might yet bless the spot, some waxed bold, and for a time took leave of those who were called to “sing ayont [about] the moon”, groping amidst the material around and stringing it up, ventured on a home-made lilt.—Short was the search to find a newly kindled love, or some old heart abreaking. Such was aye amongst us and not always unnoticed, nor, as ye shall see, unsung.
It was not enough that we merely chaunted, and listened; but some more ambitious, or idle if you will, they in time would try a self-conceived song. Just as if some funny little boy, bolder than the rest, would creep into the room where lay Neil Gow’s fiddle, and touch a note or two he could not name. How proud he is! how blest! for he had made a sound, and more, his playmates heard it, faith! Here I will introduce one of these early touches [the lyrics to Thom’s air ‘Lass, gin you lo’e me, tell me noe’].
[…]
This ditty was sung in the weaving shops, and when in the warbling of one who could lend a good voice to the occasion, and could coax the words and air into a sort of social understanding, then was it a song.
I cannot remember the precise date of this melancholy creation. Sure enough some time around 1826, when banks were falling like meteors, but rather oftener; the world seemed hurrying to ruin […] Amidst all this, and more than all this, weavers would sing.

Their native country is Basilicata, where the inhabitants of the Apennines learn from their infancy to wield the mattock with one hand, and the flageolet or bagpipe with the other. In these savages of Italy, music is not merely an art of pastime or luxury, but a talent awakened by necessity. Their usual employment is hoeing out drains, to draw the water off the land; but as there is not every year, nor in all seasons, a superabundance of rain, they take up their musical instruments for a maintenance, and, in small parties, travel over Italy, France, and Spain. Some have penetrated even into America, and returned from thence with great comparative riches, earned by their pastoral melody. Their concerts are generally composed of two musicians, who play on very long, large bagpipes, in unison:—I mean as to the tone, because one is always an octave higher than the other; while a third musician sounds a kind of hautboy, and, at the end of each ritornel, chants a rural ditty, to which the bagpipes play an accompaniment. The airs are all nearly alike, upon the model of the following Pastorale or Siciliana. [...]
&nbsp;The trifling differences depend upon a greater or lesser vivacity in the performers, who are wont to embellish the common tune with variations, out of their own fancy. Every air, however, is composed of two characters: the ritornel is cheerful; the vocal part, slow and mournful.

Notwithstanding its French origin &nbsp;and treatment, “Esmeralda” was in all essential &nbsp;matters an English opera, and as such the public &nbsp;knew and remembered it.

The predominant position of Paderewski had long since been assured; now, however, came Moritz Rosenthal and Eugen d'Albert, seeking a London endorsement of the reputations they had already won on the Continent and in America. In each case the general verdict was emphatically ratified. Moritz Rosenthal's debut at the Richter concerts (June 10, 1895), when he played the Liszt concerto in E flat, created a genuine sensation; and his subsequent recitals confirmed the opinion that he possessed the most phenomenal technique of any living pianist.",http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/day/1895-06-10,http://dbpedia.org/resource/St_James's_Hall,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/574c6820a700929bc519e8d3aebcbf6b/1438592172047,Indoor Public Accompanied,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Hermann+Klein/1438157240872,Hermann Klein,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra http://dbpedia.org/resource/Piano,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Concerto

Mr. Brock (Baptist) is the minister of Bloomsbury&nbsp;chapel, Bloomsbury street. He is a very popular preacher, and has a large and flourishing congregation. Not indeed like the great German congregations where we often see two or three&nbsp;thousand people assembled on a Sabbath mornings but there were not less, we think, than a thousand persons present at the Bloomsbury chapel last Sunday. The church is furnished with a very good-sized organ, though its tones are harsh, and especially so are the stops of small pipes, as mixture or cornet. There is no choir, but the singing is by the people, and seems&nbsp;to be very general. There was a chorus of many voices; a chorus not of musical attraction, but of religious edification - excellent and appropriate. Chanting had been introduced into this congregation, and is practised by the whole collected assembly with much success. We do not hesitate to say that the chanting by all the people in Rev. Mr. Brock's church is much&nbsp;superior to any of the cathedral choir chanting which we have heard. The chant itself was, indeed, unfavorable to the best results, being the well-known Dr. Dupuis in A; but notwithstanding the tune-like character of the chant, the effect was truly good, and seemed to furnish a most satisfactory answer to&nbsp;those objectors to chanting, who say that it is impossible for a large congregation to chant together. The words were, in general, deliberately and well delivered, and with a good degree of simultaneousness on the part of the congregation. Chanting is practised in public worship in many dissenting churches in&nbsp;London, and in other parts of the kingdom. Indeed, although it was introduced at an earlier period into our New England churches than here, yet it seems to have spread more here, and to have taken deeper root. One reason for this may be, that here it is made a republican thing; it is in the hands of the&nbsp;people, and they like it. The metrical psalms were also quite well sung, and the great importance of an organ in Congregational singing was made very apparent. A custom in giving out the hymn and tune is singular. The minister first gives out the number of the hymn, and immediately afterwards the organist plays over the tune. After this the minister, who&nbsp;stands in the pulpit during the playing, reads the hymn, and then the singing follows.&nbsp;
Mr. Brock has made a much-needed reform in relation to the public prayer. He has broken up the ever-so-long prayer, and instead of it has two shorter prayers. Rev. Mr. Binney of the Weigh House chapel has done the same. The devotional exercises occupied an hour, and the sermon that followed about forty minutes, after which the meeting was dismissed by the usual benediction.&nbsp;",1852-Ll-uu,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/d2f93cf9a159f0f9f87918e1da1ad4c9,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/6a44b53215025970dfcf5cae3368ba60/1461671005396,Indoor Accompanied Public,http://musicbrainz.org/artist/f422b99a-b48c-4bee-bc0c-f2e8cad82b6c#_,Dr. Lowell Mason Lowell Mason,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pipe_organ http://data.open.ac.uk/led/thing/congregation,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_music

The ""Nozze di Figaro,"" in which the gifted singer warbled the part of Susanna with unusual grace and feeling (supported by Parodi as the Countess, and Alboni as Cherubino), was the last opera in which Madame Sontag appeared during the season of 1849. Her success had been all that could be hoped - far greater indeed than had been expected. Under the guise of her engaging smile, fortune seemed again to have beamed upon the theatre. At all events, the promise for the ensuing season of 1850 was more cheering under the new auspices of Sontag than might have been anticipated a few months before. &nbsp;&nbsp;",1849-uu-uu,,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/3b4963c189994b0ebe93ae9252503423/1438778704903,Accompanied Public Indoor,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Benjamin+Lumley/1438607277398,Benjamin Lumley,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

Mr. Lowell Mason—a prominent figure in the musical history of the United States. I believe he was never absent from any of our chamber concerts except when out of town. I well remember how, one night in the old Masonic Temple, when we had finished playing Mendelssohn’s Quartette in D, op. 44, Mr. Mason rose from his seat in the second row, came to the stage, laid the score of the quartette at my feet, said, “ It was beautifully played; please keep the score; sorry I cannot stay longer,” and walked out in the stately, self-possessed manner so perfectly in keeping with his character.",180u-uu-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boston,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/553e321ba5d1aeb2d0eb774000d2ec48/1450266188304,Public Accompanied Indoor,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Thomas+Ryan/1448997315048,Thomas Ryan,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Piano,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_music

He played five of the fugues of John Sebastian Bach — he cares not to play other music. Bach is his musical Bible, and he has read him so much that he has ceased to take pleasure in inferior or uninspired writers. Bach is musical truth, unmixed with error; it is really interesting to see with what enthusiasm his works are spoken of, played, and heard by the German Musicians. Herr Schneider used no fancy stops, made no see-sawings with the swell, no contrasts of reeds and dulcianas, no high-diddle-diddles in his playing. His appeal is always to the intellectual musician.

The musical part of the Jubilee—all things considered,—was noble and dignified. The great chorus, the great orchestra, the great organ, the great drum, and the great singer, Parepa Rosa, with her wonderful, never-to-be- forgotten rendering of the Inflammatus, may seem, at this distance of time and development of musical taste, as something only “great” to laugh at. Yet, when a whole serious-minded community like that of Boston “ took stock ” in it, and the spirit of the idea was carried out happily, is it not perhaps rash to mock at it ?

I find that BEETHOVEN'S secretary wrote, in 1823, to BEETHOVEN: ""You will be present at little LISZT'S concert, will you not? It will encourage the boy. Promise me that you will go."" And BEETHOVEN went. When the ""little LISZT"" stepped on to the platform, he saw BEETHOVEN in the front row; it nerved instead of staggering him he played with an abandon and inspiration which defied criticism. Amidst the storm of applause which followed, BEETHOVEN was observed to step up on the platform, take the young virtuoso in his arms, and salute him, as LISZT assured me, ""on both cheeks."" This was an event not to be lightly forgotten, and hardly after fifty-seven years to be alluded to without a certain awe; indeed, LISZT'S voice quite betrayed his sense of the seriousness of the occasion as he repeated, with a certain conscious pride and gravity, ""Oui, j'ai recu le baiser de BEETHOVEN."" &nbsp; ",1823-uu-uu,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/35eec7edec3b5fcafd4ef57f7b41be55,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/47a788a0a4645525a41a15be69c9a9fc/1438003895413,Accompanied Indoor Public,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ludwig_van_Beethoven,Ludwig von Beethoven Beethoven Beethoven Ludwig van Beethoven,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Piano,

Eugen d'Albert was regarded in the light of a “prodigal”. A native of Glasgow and educated at The National Training School for Music in London, he might with all fairness have been termed a British product. He preferred, however, to call himself a German, and had not stood upon an English concert platform since boyhood till he appeared at Queen's Hall under Felix Mottl (April 28, 1896), and gave a magnificent performance of Beethoven's E flat or “Emperor"" concerto. He had a cold reception, but after he had played it became evident that the old grievances had been forgotten in the presence of a legitimate virtuoso, of a true artist possessing the fire of unmistakable genius. Personally I admire his playing immensely; and as an interpreter of Beethoven, it is upon the shoulders of d'Albert that the mantle of Rubinstein, to my thinking, has fallen. His place as a composer will have to be decided by a future generation.",http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/day/1896-06-28,,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/b4c23911338d1e5d01d70a6231b8ba1f/1438592480306,Indoor Public Accompanied,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Hermann+Klein/1438157240872,Hermann Klein,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra http://dbpedia.org/resource/Piano,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Concerto

Boston was even then quite a Mecca for instrumentalists.
Among those who made the greatest impression on me were three genuine artists who formed a little company,—Sivori, violinist, Knoop, violoncellist, Henry Herz, pianist. The latter was spoken of with great acclaim by the newspapers as the composer of variations on Home, Sweet Home. His position was thereby fixed at the top round of the art ladder. He did play his own compositions quite neatly, also those of Rosellen and kindred composers, and I was present when he took part in a piano trio by Haydn; but I fear his playing would not pass muster in these days. The cellist, Knoop, was of the regulation pattern of well- trained virtuosi, who could play the elder Romberg’s compositions. But Sivori was really a master violinist—an advance Wieniawski, without the latter’s ability to compose violin music. Sivori had a marvellous technique.

About this time I received a decided impulse from hearing a little girl, aged six, play on the violin exquisitely, and, as it seemed to me, prodigiously. There were three sisters, named TURNER; the eldest was only fifteen : two played the harp, and the youngest, a pretty child of six, played the violin. She had one of those miniature instruments I believe a real Cremona which can still occasionally be picked up at old violin shops. I remember the enthusiasm she created in some variations on airs from ""Sonnambula"" an opera in which JENNY LIND was making furor at the time in London. The poor little violinist was recalled again and again. It was past eleven, and as she came on in her little pink dress just down to her knees holding her tiny fiddle I recollect her raising it to her chin to begin again, but her little head lay so wearily on one side, and she looked so tired that her acute father came forward, perceiving that the child was quite worn out, drew her away, and in a few words asked the people to let her off, adding that she ought to have been in bed an hour ago.

Sontag is gone, and the Gewandhaus Orchestra is thrown upon its own strength and resources; but it fails not, neither is it faint or weary. The Eighteenth Concert was (save the charming singer) one of the very best of the season. The Orchestra (said one who has often heard) never played better; well might they feel the inspiration of their author, for they played Beethoven's 4th Symphonic, than which he has not written a better. It is not so well known in America, but it cannot rank second to anything which Beethoven has composed.
The adagio (sextuple movement) is as perfect in design and as beautiful in coloring as in any work of musical art. Fraulein Anna Klassig sang a Recitative and Arie from Sphor's Jessonda. Herr G. Kruger, from Stuttgart, played two pieces well on the Harp; and a well-trained choir, Pauliner Sänger-Vereins, of fifty men’s voices sung three pieces, two of which were by Mendelssohn, and one of which may be found in the “Fireside Harmony” (Waserfahrt.) Mendelssohn’s Overture ""Melusine,"" as fine an Overture as exists, was played; and the performance was worthy of the composition.
These Concerts are very popular and fashionable. The Musical Professors are all there, expectation is fully awake, and I believe almost always fully gratified.

Playing in this new theatre was for me an agreeable change. It had, for those days, quite a sizable orchestra. The leader sat facing the stage, and was for a long time the only first violin. We had but one second violin, one viola, one contrabass, no violoncello, one flute, two clarinets, one fagott, two horns, a trumpet, a trombone, and drums. The kind and quality of music played would nowadays strike one as queer. It consisted of overtures, quadrilles, polkas, galops—in short, mostly dance music. There was a total absence of so-called popular music, if we except a few quicksteps and marches. There were no characteristic pieces such as figure on the programmes of today.
I well remember the first one we were asked to play. It was called the Matrimonial Galop. It was of ordinary construction, the only reason for its peculiar name being a sudden hold-up, where the drummer or leader, I forget which, blew into a little instrument that gave out a sound like the cry of a baby. That childish noise made the audience roar with delight, and we had to play it nightly. We poor musicians suffered ; but one night we had our revenge. The usual calls came from the audience—they wanted the baby-cry, but did not get it The machine crying-baby had vanished— it could not be found. Consternation reigned among those who wanted the people pleased, no matter how it was done. We tried to appease the audience by playing the galop; but when we came to the spot of spots, and there was no realistic baby-cry, but only a base imitation made on the fiddle, a howl of derision and rage went up, equal to anything ever heard in a menagerie. The disappointment was more than the audience could stand.",184u-uu-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boston,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/ab1bfe9cfe9d0a7a5f83197f5ca89828/1449564475544,Indoor Public Accompanied,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Thomas+Ryan/1448997315048,Thomas Ryan,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Violin http://dbpedia.org/resource/Viola http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trumpet http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horn_(instrument) http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cello http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flute http://dbpedia.org/resource/Drum http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trombone http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clarinet,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dance_music

Of course we all smiled when the opening theme of the finale suggested that unmistakable resemblance to the corresponding subject in the last movement of Beethoven's “Ninth”, which Brahms always protested he could not perceive.

As at the military concert in Hamburg, they played with thrilling effect a programme of about twenty pieces separately and unitedly. In the music for the combined bands there was not that replication of parts so common in similar performances in England, but it was specially arranged so that each band in turn took its part accompanied by the others. The whole performance concluded with a military piece entitled the “Battle of Leipzig,” in which cannons were fired at intervals with unerring precision at the beginning of the bar.

My last recollection of Heidelberg is a concert given by the celebrated violinist Joachim. I was taken to it as a great treat, and wore a new silk dress for the occasion.

It is an awful confession, but I am obliged to make it.

Music receives more attention here than at, perhaps, any of the other Paris churches; and the whole mass was, to-day, quite well done. The choir, including ministers, boys, and all, numbered about fifty persons. There are two organs; a large one at the end of the gallery, occupying about the place in the house that organs generally do with us; and a smaller one in the choir, near the altar. This latter was used exclusively for accompaniment, and the former, or large one, was played only when some flourish of overture or march triumphant was desired. Then it sent forth its tones loud and jubilant, so as to make the welkin ring again. The music was quite modern; as much so as if composed by the latest Donizetti or Verdi, and quite in the orchestral, anti-ecclesiastical style. It was indeed vocal, — words were sung; but, as they could not be understood, the effect of the whole was such as is the musical effect in a grand pantomime. Indeed, the worship in the Roman Catholic cathedrals seems to be little else than a mute, gesticulatory action of bowings, crossings, and kneelings, with grand processions, musical accompaniment, &amp;c. Musically considered, how ever, the performance was good. It was prompt and energetic, and the pianos and fortes were well observed.

I recollect how perfectly she sang some French pieces and a new romanza (""II primo amore,"" I think it was called) expressly composed for her by Romili. But what dwells most vividly in my memory in connection with this concert is her extreme kindness to my brother Max, who was down in the same programme for a violin solo. The great artist insisted on sitting among the audience to listen to the little English fiddler (then about thirteen); and he had just started his solo when one of his strings broke. He gave one glance of consternation round the room and then incontinently burst into tears. The audience looked half amused ; but Alboni rose from her seat, walked to my brother, and, kissing him upon the forehead, said, loudly enough for every one to hear, ""N'importe, mon petit ami; ne pleurs pas!

Sontag is gone, and the Gewandhaus Orchestra is thrown upon its own strength and resources; but it fails not, neither is it faint or weary. The Eighteenth Concert was (save the charming singer) one of the very best of the season. The Orchestra (said one who has often heard) never played better; well might they feel the inspiration of their author, for they played Beethoven's 4th Symphonic, than which he has not written a better. It is not so well known in America, but it cannot rank second to anything which Beethoven has composed.
The adagio (sextuple movement) is as perfect in design and as beautiful in coloring as in any work of musical art. Fraulein Anna Klassig sang a Recitative and Arie from Sphor's Jessonda. Herr G. Kruger, from Stuttgart, played two pieces well on the Harp; and a well-trained choir, Pauliner Sänger-Vereins, of fifty men’s voices sung three pieces, two of which were by Mendelssohn, and one of which may be found in the “Fireside Harmony” (Waserfahrt.) Mendelssohn’s Overture ""Melusine,"" as fine an Overture as exists, was played; and the performance was worthy of the composition.

I also set a good many French poems. Perhaps the best known of these is Sully Prudhomme’s “Ici-bas.” Monsieur Jules Diaz de Soria, to whom it is dedicated, sang it most beautifully. I dare say there are many of us who remember his lovely baritone voice, and the absolutely perfect way he sang certain French songs- “Crépuscule,” and “Sérenade,” by Massenet, for instance. His singing was full of fascination and charm. The voice was not a very big one, but its quality was absolutely perfect. I remember thinking on one occasion, “If a palm tree could sing, it would sing like de Soria.”
&nbsp;
There was something extraordinarily exotic in his voice which also suited his appearance admirably, for he looked exactly like an Oriental. When he sang a love song he held one spellbound. The beautiful voice, so warm, so soft, so languorous, but which at times could be fierce and passionate, exercised an almost hypnotic influence on many people. Involuntarily one dreamed of love, intense, voluptuous, in some far-away tropical island.",188u-uu-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/England,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/983e8e13109876d166c14a0766bb07d8/1452271486561,Accompanied,http://musicbrainz.org/artist/eca4d562-1e5c-409a-89fa-5489d102cdcb#_,Maude V.

She is a French lady, and a true artist. [...] Of her a very competent critic has said, in one of the papers, “She has never been equaled by any of her predecessors.” While we might be willing to admit the truth of this remark in regard to some particular points of excellence, we do not acknowledge it as a general truth; and it must be credited to the favorable disposition of the newspaper critic. She has a voice rich in tone, extensive in compass, and of great flexibility. Her lower register is very fine, having more power than that of Sontag; indeed this is true of her whole compass, and in this particular she may be compared to Jenny Lind. With respect to quality and purity of tone, we think the latter lady may have the preference in the higher register, but elsewhere the voice of De la Grange is superior. In her lesson in the “Barber,” of Rossini, she ran up with apparent ease to the thrice-marked small g; and in her songs in the Zauberflöte she touched the thrice-marked small f with the ease and accuracy of a pianoforte. She sings with a freedom, openness, frankness of voice (so to speak) that we have scarcely ever heard equaled, and never excelled. She is, perhaps, thirty years of age, and of most interesting personal appearance, good figure, large and bewitching eyes, easy, graceful, and elegant in every movement and gesticulation.

Instead of returning to the platform to bow, as ninety-nine singers in a hundred would have done, he seized hold of my hand.
&nbsp;
“Come back with me,” he said; “ I am going to sing again.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ,
&nbsp;
And how he sang the second time ! I am not quite certain which song he repeated - he believed in them both. But so determined was he to give me my chance that he absolutely attacked the audience with the splendour of his singing, with the magnetism of his personality. It was like a tidal wave sweeping everything before it, and of course he carried the crowd away with him and won the day for me, for the song was received very differently the second time he sang it. I remember perfectly well feeling half frightened at the idea of going back to face that multitude of people whose applause, I thought, in no way justified my reappearance at all events. But of course I did as I was told. On&nbsp;

The singing was mostly by a chorus of about two hundred children, who sang in two parts, girls singing first, boys second. They sang in tolerably good time and tune, but in no better taste than we have heard some of the children's choruses in America. There was a kind of nasal, or feline quality of tone, which was anything but pleasant. [...] The singing, by children, of music unfit for them, or unadapted to their capacities, is a very common fault; on the present occasion a glee by Callcott was attempted, to sacred words, which had better been omitted; and at the close of the services, after the benediction, the poor children, not knowing what they were about, but led on by those who ought to have known better, made a bold attack on Handel’s Hallelujah. It hardly need be added that the performance came as near to the ridiculous as need be; there was nothing good about it except the intentions of the children; they were innocent through ignorance; but not so with the teachers, for ignorance cannot, in a teacher, excuse such error in judgment and carelessness in execution.&nbsp;",1852-09-Ee,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/2146927288cec677d98c3dfdcdbd7baf,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/7e646c5f3e17f17650be91ba0d7d8762/1448921275704,Accompanied Indoor Public,http://musicbrainz.org/artist/f422b99a-b48c-4bee-bc0c-f2e8cad82b6c#_,Dr. Lowell Mason Lowell Mason,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Choir http://dbpedia.org/resource/Female_vocals http://dbpedia.org/resource/Male_vocals,

I rather enjoyed those classes [at the house of Madame Leupold], and sat amongst the contraltos and helped to make a noise. But there was one member of our little society who made a great deal more noise than I did, for he was able to sing two different notes at one and the same time; the effect was quite startling, so much so that I was positively fascinated by him, and stared at him with such interest that Mr. Rose-Innes, who sang with the basses, laughingly accused me of having lost my heart to him!

Then we had the Rasoumoffski Quartette in F, op. 57, by Beethoven, with Wieniawski playing first violin. Then the Schumann Piano Quintette, with Rubinstein at the piano. Oh, it was a joy to take part with such a man and in such a work! and how Rubinstein did spur us on by his passionate way of playing some of the great parts! his power was fierce and tremendous. I think we all revelled in the sea of sound we made about us.
After the Quintette, Rubinstein played a lot of choice solo pieces, ending the evening with the Chopin Polonaise in A flat, op. 53, in which comes the wonderful passage for the left hand in octaves. He began the phrase very soft, then the “little-by-little crescendo” was most admirably done, finally reaching a fortissimo power which was quite colossal.

Of the spiritual beauty of the ""Rainbow scene,"" which is. pictorially, worthy of TURNER, I can hardly speak. Yet even here the fateful curse that hangs over the Rheingold and all who touch it here, in the hour of joy and god-like splendour there is a hint of the final overthrow of the Walhalla and the ""Dusk of the Gods."" It is to be seen in the crimson Niebelheim light upon the mighty ramparts and towers a light that gives a sober tinge even to the rainbow it is to be heard in the haunting cry of the Rhine daughters over their lost treasure, which makes even the happy gods pause on the threshold of Walhalla. It is felt in the mingled undertones of the orchestra, breaking forth at last into the strong closing bars of the Rheingold. A terrible firmness of purpose, beyond the control even of the gods themselves, is urging forward the course of all things in heaven and earth; none may go back; none may look behind. The old Anangke or Necessity of the Greeks is at the bottom of all, and seems to say alike to the Rhine daughters, the dwarfs, the giants, and the gods, ""Go forward; the end must come; what will be, will be."" 
The Rheingold lasts for two hours and a half at a stretch, during which time there is no pause in the music, but there is also no sign of fatigue in the audience who sit in rapt attention to the close.",1876-08-uu,,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/2624d0db0f2e567a831f2bd5440388ee/1437993704577,Outdoor Accompanied Public,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hugh_Reginald_Haweis,Hugh Reginald Haweis,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

On Saturday the 8th July, the long-expected ""Tempest"" was produced before an over-flowing audience. The success of the work on the first night was ""tremendous."" Never, perhaps, had any new opera been received with such frenzied acclamation. The opera, there is no doubt, abounded in striking and captivating morceaux, and had been composed with earnestness and power. Of melody, there was a rich store, although the ever popular air, by Dr. Arne, ""Where the bee sucks,"" judiciously employed by the composer for the pantomimic music of his Ariel and as the finale of the opera, stood out amidst all its modern companions with a delicious freshness. 
After the performance, Monsieur Halevy, while on the stage, was overwhelmed with congratulations. All the foreign artists were warm in their expressions of delight. One after the other they approached him to say, ""How beautiful! How charming! How exquisite is this motivo!"" Each hummed a melody. The melody was invariably the same. It was that of Arne. Poor Monsieur Halevy must have winced under it, even in the midst of his glory. Moreover, there was a drawback in the decrescendo nature of the composition. Each of the three main acts of the opera (the tempest at sea having formed a prologue) was less effective (even though good in itself) than the preceding one. Nevertheless, the opera was received with a species of wild enthusiasm. Artists, composer, author, conductor, and finally the manager, were one and all called and recalled to receive the overwhelming plaudits of the crowded house. 
The singing of all employed on the occasion was ""first-rate."" Madame Sontag won herself fresh laurels, and made the part of Miranda one of the very best. But, in the midst of all that was excellent, Lablache stood out in popular estimation as the striking impersonation of the character of Caliban. It was the last, as it was the best ""creation "" of this rare artist. The music as well as the acting taxed to the utmost the powers of one already on the wane. But he rose superior to every difficulty. His Caliban was not only adjudged to be the finest delineation of the character known, even amidst the many great actors who had figured in this extraordinary part upon the English stage, but was hailed as one of the ""finest creations"" ever seen! All was novel — all was artistic in this wonderful personation. His ""dull earthiness"" and ""brute ferocity,"" his expression of animal love for Miranda, his savage exultation under the influence of wine, and his grovelling, but still revengeful despair, combined to form a masterpiece, and raised Lablache — if anything could raise him — to a loftier pinnacle of fame than before. Scarcely less striking was the Ariel of Carlotta Grisi, who exhibited more ""mind"" as well as more poetry of expression in this, than in any previous choreographic effort. Coletti, Baucarde, and Mademoiselle Parodi (in the spirited little part of the sailor Stephana, as it stood in operatic form), all came in for the crumbs which fell from the rich harvest of acclamation so lavishly bestowed upon the above-mentioned artists. It is due to the management, at the same time, to say, that all the scenic illustrations of the ""faery"" opera were fraught with a magnificence and a poetic feeling previously unknown.

I came near being killed one night in the Howard. The elder Booth was playing the title role of Richard the Third, and was in one of his magnificent moods, when, during the development of a tragedy, he would become so impassioned and exalted that he believed himself to be a real personage in a living drama.
[…]
On the night in question I was in my usual place in the orchestra, helping to play the battle music, with one eye on the stage watching the progress of the combat, which was terribly real. In a wild paroxysm Booth knocked the sword out of Richmond’s hand with terrific force; it flew towards the orchestra, grazed the side of my head, and then stuck quivering with its point well embedded in the wooden music- desk directly behind me. I never again sat in the orchestra when any such sword-fight was in progress.",180u-Mm-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greater_Boston,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/a78d6abcd23d2fa808a4f22f64cd341f/1449565439148,Accompanied Public Indoor,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Thomas+Ryan/1448997315048,Thomas Ryan,Performance,,

The musical part of the Jubilee—all things considered,—was noble and dignified. The great chorus, the great orchestra, the great organ, the great drum, and the great singer, Parepa Rosa, with her wonderful, never-to-be- forgotten rendering of the Inflammatus, may seem, at this distance of time and development of musical taste, as something only “great” to laugh at. Yet, when a whole serious-minded community like that of Boston “ took stock ” in it, and the spirit of the idea was carried out happily, is it not perhaps rash to mock at it ? Have not the results been far-reaching, doing their work in this world of evolution just as the chromo prepares the way for high art? Who can say that a large share of Boston’s musical reputation was not earned by the Jubilees?",180u-uu-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boston,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/e16ba4d498aac78bd9806573c1f9c3e0/1450280240235,Public Accompanied,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Thomas+Ryan/1448997315048,Thomas Ryan,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra http://dbpedia.org/resource/Organ_(music),http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jubilee_quartet

In consequence of the necessity of performing quarantine we were not allowed time to examine the interior of Otranto; we were therefore not able to judge of its riches and its population, which is said to amount to 3000 souls. The quay was covered with merchandizes, and the number of ships which frequented the port made us conclude that commerce was in a flourishing state: the city also appeared busy and active. In the evening we perceived on the beach some equipages more rich than elegant, and some gentlemen on horseback well mounted. The pretty peasant girls wore bodices of taffeta and skirts of white muslin, and their heads were covered with straw hats or silk handkerchiefs.

He had called early, he said, in order to make me acquainted with the services at the Hofkirche, where he presides as court organist. I repaired at the appointed time to the church, which unequal, however, to most of our cathedrals, has a noble exterior and a very fine tower. It stands in a prominent and beautiful position near the bridge which crosses the Elbe. Here High Mass is celebrated every Sunday at eleven o’clock, and other services, such as are usual at Roman Catholic churches, follow during the day.&nbsp;The service on this occasion was most imposing, the large orchestra in the great West Gallery being occupied by about sixty performers (band and chorus), and the large organ, one of Silbermann’s best instruments, of which I intend to give a description in my next letter. Crowds of people were pressing on, and it was with some difficulty that I gained an entrance, and obtained access to Herr Merkel’s organ pew. The music consisted of a Mass in F minor, by the conductor, Herr Carl Krebs; an Offertorium, by Rastrelli ; and a Graduale, by Reissiger. With such a force of practical musicians, need I say that the music was given with thrilling power and effect ? and I have no doubt that those who were below, in the body of the church, heard the inspiring strains to much greater advantage than I who was seated amongst the performers. At the conclusion of High Mass nearly all the immense con­gregation, as well as the members of the orchestra, departed, and there followed a short service, the musical part of which was sustained by about a dozen singing boys and singing men, with organ accompaniment only. I had now an opportunity of listening to the organ, and was struck with its rich, full tone. As, however, Herr Merkel’s playing was limited to the require­ments of the service, he made an appointment with me for the following Tuesday, at ten o’clock, in order that we might hear the instrument alone and undisturbed.",187u-Mm-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dresden,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/e9c40343e9e933587ca7b30c01190cf1/1470137427993,Public Accompanied Indoor,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Dr+William+Spark/1465384918944,Dr William Spark,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_music

The group of new “Mus.

Just before dinner a quaint sort of letter was &nbsp;placed in my hands. It was from some one in the &nbsp;famous pianist's entourage, reminding me that &nbsp;M. Paderewski was very fatigued after his heavy &nbsp;work in the provinces, and begging that I would &nbsp;under no circumstances ask him to play that evening. I was half amused, half annoyed by this unexpected communication, which, of course, I knew &nbsp;better than to regard as inspired by my guest of &nbsp;honor himself. It was also entirely superfluous, as &nbsp;I always made it a strict rule never to request an &nbsp;artist to perform in my house who did not come &nbsp;there for that purpose or with that expressed intention. However, I thought no more about it until &nbsp;after dinner, when I took an opportunity to inform &nbsp;Paderewski, in a whispered “aside”, of the strange &nbsp;warning I had received. I assured him seriously &nbsp;that I had not had the slightest idea of asking him &nbsp;to play, and that my friends were more than satisfied to have the pleasure of meeting him and enjoying his society. He replied : &nbsp;“Do you imagine I think otherwise? This is a &nbsp;case of 'Save me from my friends!' That I am &nbsp;tired is perfectly true. But when I am in the mood &nbsp;to play fatigue counts for nothing. And I am in &nbsp;that mood to-night. Are you really going to have &nbsp;some music?"" &nbsp;&nbsp;''Yes, Piatti has brought his 'cello, and he is &nbsp;going to take part in the Rubinstein sonata in D.""&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""Then I should like to play it with him; and more beside, if he will permit me. Piatti and I &nbsp;are now old colleagues at the “Pops,” and we always get on splendidly together."" &nbsp;&nbsp;What could I say?— save express my gratitude, &nbsp;and apprise my friends of the treat that was in &nbsp;store. It was the more welcome because it was virtually unexpected. An unalloyed delight was the &nbsp;performance of that lovely sonata by the “Prince &nbsp;of 'Cellists” and the greatest of living pianists. &nbsp;Both seemed to revel in the beauties of a work admirably designed for the display of their respective instruments, and the rendering was in every &nbsp;way perfect. After it was over, dear old Piatti, &nbsp;who rarely talked much, said to me in his quiet &nbsp;way, “I quite enjoyed that. I have played the &nbsp;sonata with Rubinstein many times, but it never &nbsp;went better than to-night.'' Later on he played &nbsp;again; and so did Paderewski— with Sullivan close &nbsp;by his side, watching with fascinated eyes the &nbsp;nimble fingers as they glided over the keys.

There was no processional hymn, the organist playing, whilst the clergy and choir took their places, a soft voluntary by Archer. The confession was monotoned throughout, the more modern pretty cadences, which were permitted to be sung for some years, being now, happily, excluded. The whole of the versicles, etc., were the beautiful and time-honoured work of Tallis. The Venite was sung to a single chant by Nares, and the Psalms for the day to a double chant in A minor and major by Battishill. I very much doubt if the major adaptation of this chant was written by Battishill, any more than was the chord of the six-four preceding the tonic at the end of the second phrase. A fine effect has always been obtained at the Parish Church by the basses alone giving out, in impressive unison, the first half of the chant, the second half being followed by the full choir. It might, perhaps, have been an improvement if there had been a little more variety of expression and power in the chanting of the Psalms, in every verse of which there lies a u point to seize,” and the perception of this point will give a feeling in the rendition which will be taken as coming from the heart, although, in fact, it may be only from the lips. The choir, I venture to think, stand as precentors to the congregation, and their delivery of the poetry of the Psalms will govern the delivery of the congregation. Every syllable should be distinctly uttered—no gabble, no hurry. It would be as well that every church choir should have a master in this phonic science, in order that the Psalms shall be chanted in rythmical rule—every verse, in fact, marked out as to its harmonious form in language. I need not say how gratifying it was to me to hear the service of my lifelong friend, the late Henry Smart, sung with such power and expression. Of this work I may perhaps be permitted to repeat, what I have said elsewhere, that it is agreed by the most eminent church musicians there is nothing more complete or beautiful of its class in the whole range of music, and nothing, indeed, can be more plain or straightforward, and at the same time more appropriate to the words of the grand Ambrosian hymn than the opening phrases, “ We praise Thee, O God ; we acknowledge Thee to be the Lord"". For dignity, power, and a grand conception of the text we must go on to that part of the Te Deum commencing, “ When Thou tookest upon Thee to deliver man.” The manner in which this sublime passage is built up, rising chord upon chord with rich and flowing music, seems as if it would never stop until it reached the gates of heaven itself. It would, I think, be an improvement, of which the composer himself approved, if the closing phrase of this sublime Te Deum were sung slower and very piano, instead of in strict and unrelenting time. Smart’s Te Deum is a pattern in plan and execution. It has served to create an emulative feeling, to open new fountains, and to justify and encourage freedom in form, and a strong exhibition of individual spirit. The Creed of St. Athanasius was sung to Tallis’s old two-note chant, consisting of C and B only in the melody, and this becomes somewhat monotonous unless a great power of tone and expression be given to certain passages of the text, especially at the words, “ but One God,” etc., which is greatly enhanced by a slow and deliberate accentuation. The “Introit” (which formerly was an antiphone sung while the priest proceeded to the altar to celebrate Mass), was, “ How lovely are the messengers,” from Mendelssohn’s St. Paul and the “Anthem,” an extract from Spohr’s Last Judgment, “ And lo! a throne,” etc. Both of these were sung with good taste, and in the latter the beautiful voice of Mr. Blagbro was heard to great advantage in the solos. It would, perhaps, have been more satisfactory if one of the anthems had been by an English composer, and surely there could have been no difficulty in finding such a work. The only hymn sung was, “ Holy, Holy, Holy,” to Dykes’s well-known tune Trinity, in which the congregation joined with great devotional fervour. The Post Communion Service was Tours in F, and, excellent as it is in its way, I could not help regretting that Smart’s magnificent setting was not taken so as to have continued his services throughout the day. The whole of this important part of the service, especially the unaccompanied responses and hymn, exhibited in the highest degree the efficiency of the choir. It has been truly said that the high choir service of our Church was made out of the office of Morning Prayer. The Communion office or Mass is, of course, the high musical service in the Latin Church ; but our English Communion office, until within these few years, was a sober, secret, and almost somniferous celebration, without choir, and almost without communicants. And so it is now in too many of our local churches. But more of this hereafter.
The service was concluded with what is known as Stainer’s ""Amen,” introduced first in St. Paul’s Cathedral, for which it was specially written. It contains some fine harmonical progressions, and is undoubtedly very cleverly put together, but there are two bars therein so very much like one of Palestrina’s celebrated works as would almost cause me to mistake one for the other. During the departure of the congregation, Dr. Creser played an expressive little voluntary on the sweet stops of the echo and choir organs, which were, I believe, voiced by Schulze himself.
On special occasions—Christmastide and Lent—oratorios are given in the Parish Church with increased musical resources, and greatly, I am persuaded, to the religious edification of those who attend them. Listening to an oratorio or an anthem is no direct act of worship, whether in or out of a church, nor is listening to a sermon ; but the hearing of an oratorio is, with that of hearing a sermon, a religious act, and commonly a much more profitable and instructive employment of time.
&nbsp;I will conclude this notice by observing that all church music should be of so exalted a character as will delight the genuine composer, exhilarate the organist and singers, and stimulate each and all to exert their utmost abilities for the attainment of a musical service as faultless as possible.",187u-Ll-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leeds,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/dac9293f81c31541495f2fc7b0e6c1c3/1469632157192,Public Indoor Accompanied,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Dr+William+Spark/1465384918944,Dr William Spark,Performance,,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_music

At last, through the kind intervention of the late Mr. Anson, a man justly honoured with the confidence of the Court, I overcame all difficulties. ""Roberto il Diavolo"" was duly licensed, and the eventful night arrived. 
Rarely was ever seen such an excitement even at that focus of excitement — Her Majesty's Theatre. The crowd at the doors might have led to the suspicion of an emeute, in a capital less orderly than London; and the struggle for entrance was violent beyond precedent — so violent, indeed, that the phrase, ""a Jenny Lind crush,"" became a proverbial expression. Nor was this crowd the result of a hasty gathering. From an early hour in the afternoon, the Haymarket became so thronged as to be impassable to pedestrians. As for the file of carriages, it seemed as interminable as it was dense. 
The brilliant appearance of the house inside was increased by the presence of the Queen and Prince Albert, the Queen Dowager, and Duchess of Kent, who had all come to witness the debut of Jenny Lind. 
On the entrance of the new prima donna as Alice, the welcome given to one who, though unknown, had already won renown, was unusually enthusiastic. For a few moments she appeared bewildered and ""scared,"" but her self-possession returned. Her very first notes seemed to enthral the audience. The cadenza at the end of her opening air — the whole of which was listened to with a stillness quite singular — called down a hurricane of applause. From that moment her success was certain. The evening went on, and before it ended Jenny Lind was established as the favourite of the English opera public. Voice, style, execution, manner, acting — all delighted. The triumph was achieved. 
At the end of the performance, the Queen, who during the entire evening had repeatedly manifested her extreme satisfaction, expressed to me her admiration in a tone and manner that showed how deep an impression had been made upon her. ""What a beautiful singer!"" ""What an actress!"" ""How charming!"" ""How delightful!"" Those were the exclamations that fell from the lips of Her Majesty, whom I had never before seen thus moved to enthusiasm.",1847-uu-uu,,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/b7a3a8bc08cf20995a4d026b4ede75e7/1438703626116,Accompanied Public Indoor,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Benjamin+Lumley/1438607277398 http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Queen+Victoria/1393599242108,Benjamin Lumley Queen Victoria,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

Borodin, I believe, was also a Professor of Chemistry. The friend who took us to the concert was devoted to music. He said, alluding to combinations and harmonies that then were considered extremely daring and eccentric -
“Quand à moi, j’aime bien cette musique modern - il y survient toujours quelque petit malheur intéressant et amusant quand on ne s’y attend guère.”

As we proceeded on our route, we traversed woods which shaded a soft green turf; we forded little brooks, or climbed small hills covered with myrtles, sage, and rosemary. The sun which falls direct on these unsheltered and uncultivated spots, almost burns them, rendering the odours of the plants still more strong, and drinking up their balsamic emanations, which rise like the incense of gratitude to the great Creator. I gave way to the beauty of the scene, and, plunged into contemplative thought, I made no answers but in monosyllables to my young guide; and he, on his side, withdrawing himself, instigated no doubt by the chaunting of the birds, began gaily to sing those beautiful airs which the people of this land so much delight in, and the melodious simplicity of which is truly charming. What is that natural taste which is found only in Italy, where every simple villager, every child that sings is accompanied immediately by the bye-standers with such taste and judgment? In joining their voices the same air is continued, not in the same tones, but with the melody of different parts. Whence does that tact arise, that nice and delicate perception, which enables them to catch the most harmonious notes, and to reject every false tone? They know not the rules of music; they are ignorant of the lowest principles of composition, yet they form combinations which indicate the finest skill, and seem the effect of a sort of instinct.",17Ll-uu-uu,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/210acd1a55886ae01d5c49526b21dae1,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/6e76b9005935763fea06c9919c2a09b7/1517845688232,Solitary Outdoor Public,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Antoine+Laurent+Castellan/1517842957331,Antoine-Laurent Castellan,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice http://dbpedia.org/resource/Male_vocals,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Air_(music)

It was quite late in the season of 1877 when Etelka Gerster made her debut at Her Majesty's as Amhia in “La Sonnambula”. She was one of Mr. Mapleson's surprises. Beyond a very high register, no one expected anything extraordinary from the newcomer. Imagine, therefore, the delight of habitues when they heard for the first time a voice of exquisitely musical quality and bird-like tone, trained to execute the most difficult fiorituri and cadenzas with the utmost care, and capable of running up comfortably to the giddy height of an F in alt.

The opening dance was the “ Pas des Fleurs,” music by Max Maretzek,—then an unknown name in America ; he came over from Europe a few years later. The dance consisted of andante introduction, a set of five waltzes, and a lengthy finale. When the curtain rose, the children were seen to be built up, about thirty of them, in the form of a huge bouquet, round which were two garlands or rings of flowers (children) that swung slowly around the middle mass.
[…]
The music was good. Each waltz had its appropriate dancing figures. The finale brought all into a wild, whirling, passionate movement, and it seemed to us at times as if the whole thing must go to pieces; but the artistic plan was perfectly carried out. The “ pleasures of memory ” were never more thoroughly realized by any one than by me at this moment of writing ; after a lapse of over fifty years, the picture of the dancing children is before me in its living, pulsating shape.
The whole audience was seemingly in ecstasy with the performance. The happy, bright faces and the gleeful play of the children stirred up the deepest emotions of the spectators. Many people were in tears. I know that the old oboist at my elbow did not play many notes during the early part of the waltz, for tears ran down his face like rain. When the dance finally ended and the curtain fell, the audience was in a kind of emotional insanity, and gave vent to it in wild applause. The scenes were so wonderfully beautiful, and so unlike anything before witnessed by a majority of the audience, that they felt as if they had had a dream or vision of Paradise",1847-uu-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greater_Boston,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/a576140223a474640914c2a7fc220342/1449565982072,Accompanied Public Indoor,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Thomas+Ryan/1448997315048,Thomas Ryan,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Violin http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oboe,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ballet_(music)

The mixture was healthy and prepared our people for the greater things yet to come. Finally the red-letter day dawned which brought me a degree of happiness that I shall never forget Max Maretzek had an opera troupe in the Federal Street Theatre. He brought out Mozart’s Don Giovanni, with the fine singer Bosio as “Zerlini.” Perhaps my pleasure was heightened by the fact that the director used my score. The copy is one of the earliest published, with the German title-page, Don Juan; or, The Stone Ghost; a Comic Opera in Two Acts.

More than once did he enjoy Handel's ' Acis and Galatea,' then brought out in the full perfection of the combined fine arts, as each could be brought to bear on the performance—the bright and graceful, though frivolous poetry of Gay ; the depth and breadth and versatility of Handel's musical feeling, as he endeavoured to represent the tragedy first in preparation and then in solution ; the luxury of decoration achieving the effect and earning the praise of landscape-painting; the pastoral groups elevated by the just choice of drapery into a peasantry of ancient Greece ; and last not least effective, the voices and demeanour of the performers.",180u-Mm-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/London,"http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/Acis+and+Galatea+(,+performance+of)/1397476643587/1433947975355",Accompanied Indoor,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Christian_Charles_Josias_von_Bunsen,"Christian Charles Josias, Baron von Bunsen Baron von Bunsen Christian Karl Josias von Bunsen Christian Charles Josias von Bunsen",Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Serenade http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

In addition to her radiant beauty, there was something innocent about Mary Anderson that made a very touching appeal to those who care about what is essentially pure. She sang as she came on to the stage, and the quite delicious quality of her voice arrested my attention from the very first note. It was rich and mellow, and she produced it beautifully.

Madame Urso deserves something more than a mere passing mention. She is easily the most remarkable violin player who ever came to America and made her home among us.

Yet, when not playing, she is full of fun, and her conversation is richly humorous.

Far more important was the reappearance of Mr. Sims Reeves on the boards of Her Majesty's Theatre. All former differences had been amicably arranged with the management, and he came again to assert his true position as one of the best of European tenors. His task was a severe one. He had still to contend with the ill-judged fastidiousness and one-sided prejudice of a class of opera-goers who will never allow any singer, whatever his merits, to be great in his own country. But Reeves accomplished his task with admirable artistic skill, and won his golden spurs in the battle with prejudice in the part of Ernani.

Four of the larger boys had clarionets in their hands, and, on a signal being given, the whole company folded their hands and shut their eyes and sang a grace, accompanied by the clarionets. This was the most affecting song of the day; it was indeed much aided by sight, but the effect was to ""enforce tears"" from many an eye.

We held a matinee of classic music every Saturday, and the pupils were expected to be present. Those who were capable of playing ensemble music had therefore frequent opportunity of doing it with the Quintette Club. The same privilege was given to singers.
Our plans were all right, and we started off with goodly numbers,—not far from two hundred pupils. In October, just one month later, the great Boston fire occurred; and it made everybody poor. The majority of the pupils were from the city or neighborhood, and over one half of them were forced to notify us that they could not continue their attendance another term. The fire really killed our school. We worried along to the end of the year, met our losses as best we could, and returned to our old system of travelling,—in short, “took to the road ” again.",187u-Ee-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boston,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/0ac943504bccacad634f5b80699a583f/1450279413044,Domestic Accompanied Indoor,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Thomas+Ryan/1448997315048,Thomas Ryan,Performance,,

The fine old cloisters of the monastery join the church, and surround a spacious court. Their Gothic pillars, groined arches, and curved roof, are enriched with the fine frescoes of Bernardo Zenale, who, it is said, assisted Leonardo in the plan of the Cenacolo. But though they still exhibit tints of ultra-marine, blue and bright as the skies that shine over them, they were chipping off and falling at our feet as we passed. Here, where many a morbid enthusiast had paced in the silence of brooding meditation, or gazed on the moonlight which illumined the frescoes of Bernardo, we found only the noise and bustle of military existence. In one place an artillery waggon was wheeled against a broken shrine; in another a group of soldiers laughed and sang as they smoked their pipe, seated on a prostrate crucifix: a tattered shirt hung to dry upon the flayed back of St. Bartholomew; and a musket leaning on the shoulder of a Virgin gave her the air of a sentinel on his post.

One night, just as the last notes of that overture had been struck on the piano, the door opened - it was at Guildford - someone came in with a newspaper - ""MENDELSSOHN is dead."" ""Dead!"" echoed the girl who had been playing the treble, her hand falling from the white keys as though suddenly paralysed ""dead!"" She rose from the piano and walked to the other end of the room. I was watching her. I had desolate thoughts of my own. ""I shall never see him now"" I thought; ""he will make no more music “The girl came back. She was silent and agitated; she could not control her emotion, and she left the room hurriedly. Others were there, but none seemed to feel it as she did, or as I did.

I [William Gardiner] was in the director's pew; and Lord George Cavendish, who was expressing regret at the loss of Miss Stephens, in a conversation with the Duke of Devonshire, asked my opinion of Mrs. Salmon as a singer. I said, "" My lord, I came with an expectation of being much gratified by your musical treat, but am not at all disappointed at the change ; you promised me silver, but unexpectedly give me gold."" This observation reconciled them, and they began to listen in something like good humour.

The concert opened with an overture which is a great favorite here, and often played in public, though I have not heard it in America,— “Iphigene in Aulis,” by Gluck. It is a charming overture, and any one’s musical reputation might safely rest on the production of a single piece like this. Its subjects are at once natural and beautiful, and they are always treated in a most masterly manner; with elaborateness it is always intelligible, and with copiousness it is never diffuse. There is no departing from the main topic of discourse, no wandering in the mazes of thick darkness, or searching for ideas, but the leading thoughts are kept ever before the mind, presented now in this form, and now in that. Its analogies are perfect, its contrasts are striking, and its light and shade are applied with the hand of a Raphael or a Turner. It is full of pleasing melody, yet always subject to the laws of good taste, and manifesting both genius and science; it is in the performance, perhaps, equally satisfactory both to the musician and to the mere unstudied lover of song.
The second piece was an extract (first and second movements) of Cherubini’s Requiem, written for male voices. This, which is one of Cherubini’s great works, was written under circumstances somewhat exciting, as I remember to have heard years ago. On some funeral occasion when a Requiem was desired, that which he had previously written was rejected, because composed for a mixed choir; this caused him to put forth his energies, in the production of a mass for men’s voices only. The music throughout is of a very high character, though it would not much interest those who desire musical gratification only from pretty tunes or pleasant voices. The first movement, “Requiem aeternam” with its accompaniment of violoncellos and double basses, is plaintive and sad, and tells only of sorrow, penitence and grief. In the “Dies irae,” the full powers of the orchestra are brought into requisition; and uniting, as was the case on the present occasion, with sixty well-trained and fearless men’s voices, the effect was awfully grand and commanding. The majestic movements, the severely dissonant harmonies, the wailings of the strings, the frightful appeals of the instruments of blast and percussion, and the cryings out of the voices, all combined to produce an effect which was, at times, truly terrific and overwhelming. The nineteen stanzas, however, have furnished an opportunity for musical contrasts which have been well introduced, affording variety and relief.
The third piece was the very unique but, to the musician, highly interesting ""Concert fur 2 claviere (c moll) Von J. S. Bach."" Following the Requiem, it was like a delightful calm after a storm, enabling one to realize where he was, to breathe easily again, and put on a cheerful countenance.
Several part-songs were then sung by the “Mannerchor” without accompaniment.
The second part consisted of the “Sinfonie in C minor, by L. Von Beethoven” What a symphonie this is! We have often heard it, and it is well known in America. We will not attempt a description; we listened with intense interest to the whole of it, hardly daring to breathe in the piano and not having the power to do so in the forte passages. Is it strange then, that, whether “in the body or out of the body” at its close, we should not be able to tell?",1852-03-12TLl:ll:ll,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leipzig,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/0895d99091284006321dbbfaf9e25eec/1448281715403,Accompanied Indoor Public,http://musicbrainz.org/artist/f422b99a-b48c-4bee-bc0c-f2e8cad82b6c#_,Dr. Lowell Mason Lowell Mason,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Overture

He had called early, he said, in order to make me acquainted with the services at the Hofkirche, where he presides as court organist. I repaired at the appointed time to the church, which unequal, however, to most of our cathedrals, has a noble exterior and a very fine tower. It stands in a prominent and beautiful position near the bridge which crosses the Elbe. Here High Mass is celebrated every Sunday at eleven o’clock, and other services, such as are usual at Roman Catholic churches, follow during the day.&nbsp;The service on this occasion was most imposing, the large orchestra in the great West Gallery being occupied by about sixty performers (band and chorus), and the large organ, one of Silbermann’s best instruments, of which I intend to give a description in my next letter. Crowds of people were pressing on, and it was with some difficulty that I gained an entrance, and obtained access to Herr Merkel’s organ pew. The music consisted of a Mass in F minor, by the conductor, Herr Carl Krebs; an Offertorium, by Rastrelli ; and a Graduale, by Reissiger. With such a force of practical musicians, need I say that the music was given with thrilling power and effect ? and I have no doubt that those who were below, in the body of the church, heard the inspiring strains to much greater advantage than I who was seated amongst the performers. At the conclusion of High Mass nearly all the immense con­gregation, as well as the members of the orchestra, departed, and there followed a short service, the musical part of which was sustained by about a dozen singing boys and singing men, with organ accompaniment only. I had now an opportunity of listening to the organ, and was struck with its rich, full tone. As, however, Herr Merkel’s playing was limited to the require­ments of the service, he made an appointment with me for the following Tuesday, at ten o’clock, in order that we might hear the instrument alone and undisturbed.",187u-Mm-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dresden,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/930b88a055fbdc15dd4335098210db3e/1470137603021,Public Accompanied Indoor,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Dr+William+Spark/1465384918944,Dr William Spark,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_music

The music was absolutely irresistible ! We looked on for some time, and then we began to realise that, after all, we were neither of us Methuselahs !
“Come on,” cried Munthe. “Why shouldn’t we dance too ?”
I hesitated for a moment. I didn’t know the steps, and said so.
“What does it matter ? Just let yourself go to the music ! Corraggio ! Avvanti!”
How we danced under that vine-covered pergola ! It was a splendid moonlight night - there wasn’t a breath of wind. Naples was visible in the distance with its flaming girdle of lights, and the contrast between our moonlit, star-lit mountain ball-room, and the glittering town, from which the sea divided us, was too beautiful for words. Every ten minutes or so one of the pretty, dark-eyed girls went round with wine, and we were obliged to make a pretence of sipping at the tumbler every time, or our hosts would have felt aggrieved.

Anticipating this, our company, consisting of three persons, went a little before the time appointed for the opening of the door; but yet we found a crowd gathered; the room filled immediately as the door was opened, but we succeeded in obtaining good seats. We had now to wait a full hour before the music commenced, but in the midst of such a multitude of good-looking and well-dressed ladies and gentlemen, all in conversation in loud and merry voices, it soon passed away. Half an hour before the commencement, the oboe was heard, running the scales, &amp;c.; this was soon followed by faggotti, corni, clarionetti, and strings; every man tuning and getting his instrument and his fingers in readiness. Mendelssohn seemed to look down from his bust immediately opposite the orchestra with approbation. At half-past six precisely, Kapelmeister Rietz takes his stand — the signal is given — every one is silent and attentive, and Beethoven’s overture (op. 124) fills the whole company with delight. This is a very pleasing overture; it is less learned, but of a more popular character than most of Beethoven’s. It is often marked with a rhythm like the music of the march or dance; and the flourishes of the brass instruments and drums almost lead one to suppose that he is listening to a military band. But still the hand of the master is seen, and although Beethoven comes down and freely holds conversation with the people, yet he always preserves his dignity, and never dishonors his profession in this pleasing composition.
A very good singer followed; Frau Leopoldine Tuczek-Herrenburg, from Berlin, in a Recitative and Arie from the opera of “Sylvana,” by C. Maria von Weber.
This was followed by a grand Concerto for the Piano Forte, with orchestral accompaniment (G moll), composed by J. Moschelles, and played by Clara Schumann. I have already spoken of Madame Schumann’s playing; her performance of this Concerto was perfect, and received the warmest approbation from the audience.
An air of De Beriot followed, by Frau Tuczek-Herrenburg; after which Madame Schumann played most charmingly a Notturno (B. major) for piano forte, by F. Chopin. In this she was encored, and played in answer to the call another piece unknown to the writer.
The second part of the concert was that in which the musical ones were most deeply interested, for it consisted of Robert Schumann's new Symphonie. This has not been published, and was played from manuscript, conducted by the author, who was cordially greeted on his appearance at the head of the orchestra. It is undoubtedly a work of great merit; but it is truly a great work, and can only be performed by a very thoroughly trained band. Its analogies and correspondencies are deeper and more hidden than in Mozart or Beethoven, but nevertheless they are there, and can be discovered to some extent even at a first hearing. The Symphonie consists of five movements, there being in addition to the usual movements a short adagio (fourth) introduced. In the second movement (scherzo), there is playfulness and relief, but throughout the whole the idea of greatness prevails; so much so as almost to oppress one with a feeling of grandeur and sublimity. The fourth movement especially seems to partake in the highest degree of this character, and stirs up the deep feelings to awe and reverence. But vain is any attempt at description, especially by one who has heard it but at a single performance. It was played with great energy; every member of the orchestra had enough to do. The captain inspired confidence, and the result was most satisfactory. There was but a momentary pause between the parts, and in this respect the learned conductor’s example is well worthy of imitation. The Symphonie occupied thirty-three minutes in its performance, and at half-past eight the concert closed.",http://data.open.ac.uk/time/interval/1852-03-uuT18:30:00/to/1852-03-uuT20:30:00,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/0a19459865ed69275723d6efb76048c9,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/74b0500790ceb1e042b0a73a763d49de/1448310509354,Indoor Accompanied Public,http://musicbrainz.org/artist/f422b99a-b48c-4bee-bc0c-f2e8cad82b6c#_,Dr. Lowell Mason Lowell Mason,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Symphony

The second appearance of Madame Tadolini was as Norma, in ""Don Pasquale."" Brilliant without finish, and perhaps also without elegance, the celebrated prima donna nevertheless elicited in this her only part after the ""Linda,"" a great amount of applause, and may again be said to have achieved a success. Brilliancy and vivacity are 'telling"" qualities with a miscellaneous audience. But the opportunities afforded this clever singer were few. One star shone with too powerful a light in the operatic sphere to allow any other star, however radiant, to sparkle within its legitimate lustre. It was difficult, indeed almost impossible, both for Cruvelli and Tadolini to shed their really bright rays, whilst the great planet Jenny Lind was in the ascendant. Of the two ladies, Cruvelli had the better chance of winning fame in England, since she had commenced her career earlier in the year, before the arrival of the all-absorbing ""Jenny."" She accordingly maintained her footing; whilst the sister ""star,"" Tadolini, set below the horizon of the Italian stage at the end of the season, once and for ever.",1848-uu-uu,,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/e5b2e5127be527cc90a677c89c1681b9/1438768044816,Accompanied Indoor Public,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Benjamin+Lumley/1438607277398,Benjamin Lumley,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

By the ordinary service, I mean that which includes no music except singing of the hymns, or chorales, which is always done by all the people. There is always an introductory motette sung by the choir, without any accompaniment; and when this is sung there is an extra choir, numbering say forty or fifty, and all the parts are represented, boys singing soprano. There is also, every other Sabbath morning, a motette by some of the great composers, performed with full orchestral accompaniments; and for this the number of the choir is still increased.

Scarcely less noteworthy was the first appearance of the well-known English tenor, Mr. Sims Reeves, in the part of Carlo, on the same occasion. It was in those days a rare event for an English singer to venture upon the boards of the Anglo-Italian stage; and the force of fashion and prejudice made the venture one of unusual difficulty. But with his advantages of Italian training and style, Mr. Sims Reeves was entitled to be fairly considered as an Italian singer. He had not only a beautiful natural organ, but expression and passion were at his command, and there can be little doubt that he might have permanently justified the enthusiastic welcome of what might be termed the ""national"" portion of the audience of Her Majesty's Theatre, and might have battled successfully against prejudice, had not difficulties, created by himself, arisen, and caused his secession for the remainder of the season.",http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/day/1848-05-20,,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/e175b188bc7e1fdad28c6dd6b59a839c/1438767372788,Indoor Public Accompanied,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Benjamin+Lumley/1438607277398,Benjamin Lumley,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

The singing was mostly by a chorus of about two hundred children, who sang in two parts, girls singing first, boys second. They sang in tolerably good time and tune, but in no better taste than we have heard some of the children's choruses in America. There was a kind of nasal, or feline quality of tone, which was anything but pleasant. [...] The singing, by children, of music unfit for them, or unadapted to their capacities, is a very common fault; on the present occasion a glee by Callcott was attempted, to sacred words, which had better been omitted; and at the close of the services, after the benediction, the poor children, not knowing what they were about, but led on by those who ought to have known better, made a bold attack on Handel’s Hallelujah. It hardly need be added that the performance came as near to the ridiculous as need be; there was nothing good about it except the intentions of the children; they were innocent through ignorance; but not so with the teachers, for ignorance cannot, in a teacher, excuse such error in judgment and carelessness in execution.&nbsp;",1852-09-Ee,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/2146927288cec677d98c3dfdcdbd7baf,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/637aaad77325faa3c04ffd0309fa7a7e/1448921325619,Accompanied Indoor Public,http://musicbrainz.org/artist/f422b99a-b48c-4bee-bc0c-f2e8cad82b6c#_,Dr. Lowell Mason Lowell Mason,Performance,,

The opera was well cast and well staged. Mr. Mapleson had seen it at the Brussels Monnaie during the preceding winter, and it was on the strength of the success won there, alike by the work and by the exponent of the title-role, that he had determined to transfer both to the boards of Her Majesty's. The Carmen in question was no other than Miss Minnie Hauk, the young American prima donna who had sung at Covent Garden one autumn season when quite a girl, but had not been heard again in London until the present year, when she made her rentree as Violetta in “La Traviata”. Her Carmen was already famous. It was considered as good dramatically as that of Mme. Galli-Marie, and in a vocal sense far superior. Garcia was simply delighted with the artistic finish, the vivacity and charm, of her performance. He thought she had caught with marvelous instinct and truth the peculiarities of the Spanish type, the coquettish manners and the defiant devilry of the wayward &nbsp;gipsy. He admired immensely the individuality of an assumption which, if it was subsequently followed upon more or less identical lines by many excellent artists, has been equaled only by three— I mean Pauline Lucca, Emma Calve, and Zelie de Lussan. Nor since have I heard a sweeter, gentler, or more persuasive Michaela than Alwina Valleria (nee Miss Lohmann, of Baltimore), another American soprano who was just beginning to win her way into the affections of the English public. The Escamillo— and an altogether ideal one— was that remarkably fine barytone, Del Puente, who in after years settled down in New York as a singer and teacher; while Campanini sang and acted with superb dramatic power as Don Jose. It was a strong cast, therefore, and Sir Michael Costa conducted the opera with exemplary care, even if he failed to bring into full relief the manifold beauties and exquisitely delicate touches of Bizet's score. But Signor Garcia was simply enthusiastic, and he labored as effectively as any individual in the whole theatre to bring about the triumphant reception that greeted “Carmen” that night. The subject and its treatment alike appealed to him; he thought the story intensely dramatic; the degree of real Spanish color in the music quite astonished him. He had not imagined that any Spanish opera after “Don Giovanni"" and “Il Barbiere"" could please him so much.",http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/day/1878-06-22,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/efdd01e256923e4b69230e1f1a023076,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/f647905f6a7857e186aa9c0c1883633f/1438246723808,Indoor Public Accompanied,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Manuel+Patricio+Rodriguez+Garcia/1438190368020 http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Hermann+Klein/1438157240872,Manuel Patricio Rodriguez Garcia Hermann Klein,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

This same year, by the way, witnessed the brief “Perosi craze”. How that purely artificial vogue ever came to extend beyond the walls of the Italian churches no one knows. At least it should have stopped short at Paris, which was as far as the youthful abbe himself contrived to get on his road to London. But for a time the “craze"" raged in England with the virulence of an epidemic, and many sane musicians persuaded themselves that the new oratorio composer was a genius of the first magnitude. His “Transfiguration"", his “Raising of Lazarus,"" and his “Resurrection of Christ"" were all performed at the London Musical Festival which Robert Newman started at Queen's Hall in May; while his “Passion of Christ"" was given at the Norwich Festival in the autumn. In each instance, however, there was felt a keen sense of disappointment.

'The music was very fine — ' the Creation,'—Spohr's ' Fall of Babylon' (a musical drama, called oratorio) —and 'Samson.' The text of the latter had been modified by Mr. Edward Taylor, so as to coincide with and comprehend that of Milton almost entirely, incorporating the newly-introduced portions by interspersing other Handelian passages, selected from his forgotten works, whether operas, or small and little noticed oratorios. According to Mr. Taylor, Handel had adopted a movement from Palestrina, and worked out a passage of ' Samson ' upon that guiding-thread : this suggested and gave occasion for the introduction of a hymn, founded upon an inexpressibly fine conception of Palestrina's. Nobody was aware of this, and all declared it to be the most striking part; the Bishop caused it to be repeated, and the whole assembly (above 2,000 in number) rose and remained standing, as during devotional pieces. After this piece, the greatest effect was produced by a short chorus, which no one had heard before : and that was, equally from the Septime, borrowed from Carissimo. This system of intercalation is in itself indefensible : but I must confess that the text, as it is, has a fine effect : the action progresses dramatically, and nothing could be easier than to make a representation with entire dramatic effect of this ' Samson' : an idea for which I sought to obtain acceptance.'",1842-09-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Norwich,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/http://data.open.ac.uk/led/music/The+Fall+of+Babylon/1434011653481/1434011653494,Accompanied Indoor,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Miss+Trotter/1434011441952 http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Lady+Williams/1434011428422 http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Mrs+Baring/1434011460627 http://dbpedia.org/resource/Christian_Charles_Josias_von_Bunsen http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Lord+Northampton/1434011412831,"Miss Trotter Lady Williams Mrs Baring Christian Charles Josias, Baron von Bunsen Baron von Bunsen Christian Karl Josias von Bunsen Christian Charles Josias von Bunsen Lord Northampton",Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chorale http://dbpedia.org/resource/Religious_music http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oratorio http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vocal_music

Sontag is gone, and the Gewandhaus Orchestra is thrown upon its own strength and resources; but it fails not, neither is it faint or weary.

It is not so well known in America, but it cannot rank second to anything which Beethoven has composed.
The adagio (sextuple movement) is as perfect in design and as beautiful in coloring as in any work of musical art. Fraulein Anna Klassig sang a Recitative and Arie from Sphor's Jessonda. Herr G. Kruger, from Stuttgart, played two pieces well on the Harp; and a well-trained choir, Pauliner Sänger-Vereins, of fifty men’s voices sung three pieces, two of which were by Mendelssohn, and one of which may be found in the “Fireside Harmony” (Waserfahrt.) Mendelssohn’s Overture ""Melusine,"" as fine an Overture as exists, was played; and the performance was worthy of the composition.
These Concerts are very popular and fashionable. The Musical Professors are all there, expectation is fully awake, and I believe almost always fully gratified.

Under these circumstances, one of the greatest excitements of the season was undoubtedly the debut of Madame Frezzolini. For some years she had held the proud position of the most celebrated prima donna on the lyric stage in Italy. Her advent was naturally heralded by many a flourish of trumpets, not one of which, perhaps, was louder than her great reputation merited. Italy had proclaimed her ""the first among the first."" There was nothing, therefore, which in the slightest degree savoured of ""humbug"" in the ""puff preliminary."" She was not only a great singer and a great actress; she was, moreover, a fine woman. Italy was enthusiastic about her — why should not England be so likewise ? As it turned out, Madame Frezzolini was received in England with favour, but not with enthusiasm. At all events, her success did not reach the point anticipated. This result may be ascribed to the fact, that her health had suffered greatly, not only from her recent confinement, but from cold and privations endured in one of the houses of refuge on Mount Cenis, where she had been sheltered during a storm for nearly three whole days. Jarring discords between herself and her hus- band, Signor Poggi (which terminated shortly afterwards in a separation), and consequent distress of mind, contributed likewise to deteriorate a voice which had been pre-eminently beautiful when heard a few months previously. The mind and ""school"" of the great artist were no longer adequately seconded by her physical powers. The fine intention still remained; but the full means for consummate execution were wanting. As it was, when the influence of the vieille garde and its numerous adherents, as well as the conservative tendency of the English public, are taken into account, it is manifest that the really great talent of Madame Frezzolini alone enabled her to maintain such a position as she actually did acquire. 
She achieved, however, notwithstanding these untoward circumstances, many a legitimate triumph during the season. 
Her first appearance was made in ""Beatrice di Tenda,"" an opera which, although it contains some of Bellini's sweetest melodies, and was supported on this occasion by both Ronconi and Guasco, failed to make a very favourable impression. 
The libretto of ""Beatrice di Tenda,"" dark, lugubrious, and painful, is in itself calculated to impress an English audience unfavourably. Nevertheless, in this opera, Ronconi completely established himself, both as singer and actor. Poggi, who had unwisely refused the tenor part, writhed with jealousy to hear Guasco invariably encored in the ""Io Soffru"", a melody which, it may be noticed, bears a considerable resemblance to the tender composition by Reissiger, known as ""Weber's last Waltz.""",1842-uu-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Her_Majesty's_Theatre,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/534277e1b0f7b3a7fd167bd93e381934/1438609061762,Accompanied Public Indoor,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Benjamin+Lumley/1438607277398,Benjamin Lumley,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

The music was good. Each waltz had its appropriate dancing figures. The finale brought all into a wild, whirling, passionate movement, and it seemed to us at times as if the whole thing must go to pieces; but the artistic plan was perfectly carried out. The “ pleasures of memory ” were never more thoroughly realized by any one than by me at this moment of writing ; after a lapse of over fifty years, the picture of the dancing children is before me in its living, pulsating shape.
The whole audience was seemingly in ecstasy with the performance. The happy, bright faces and the gleeful play of the children stirred up the deepest emotions of the spectators. Many people were in tears. I know that the old oboist at my elbow did not play many notes during the early part of the waltz, for tears ran down his face like rain. When the dance finally ended and the curtain fell, the audience was in a kind of emotional insanity, and gave vent to it in wild applause. The scenes were so wonderfully beautiful, and so unlike anything before witnessed by a majority of the audience, that they felt as if they had had a dream or vision of Paradise",1847-uu-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greater_Boston,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/a576140223a474640914c2a7fc220342/1449565982072,Accompanied Public Indoor,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Thomas+Ryan/1448997315048,Thomas Ryan,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Violin http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oboe,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ballet_(music)

Music was almost entirely neglected during my years at Miss Reach’s. I had no lessons, but was sent to practise by myself for an hour every afternoon on a horrid little upright piano in the dreary dining-room.
&nbsp;
Of course I did nothing of the sort; in the first place, I had nothing to practise, for I certainly had no intention of learning any of the really dreadful drawing-room pieces with which the piano was covered. Occasionally I played through one of them, for I read music quite easily. How I jibbed at the “Prière d’une Vierge”! The “Gems of Scotland,” set in arpeggios and triplets, were sham jewels for which I had unmitigated contempt, and one or two pieces by Brinsley Richards made my flesh creep. I had such frightful attacks of low spirits in that dreary back room that I never think of it without horror. After some months I began to connect music itself with those four walls and those hideous tenth-rate compositions which lay in bilious green and yellow covers on the top of the piano, and it seemed to me that my own love of music was being slowly poisoned to death. So much for atmosphere! When I left Miss Reach’s at the end of the year, I would not have cared if I had never set eyes on a piano again. I almost hated the sight of one. Something lovely in me had died. Or had it only fallen into a deep and dreamless sleep, like the long sleep of the Dornröschen of legend?",186u-Mm-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wolverhampton,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/d99bf520a5d38c5aee1e2951a8625113/1449243847383,Indoor Domestic Solitary,http://musicbrainz.org/artist/eca4d562-1e5c-409a-89fa-5489d102cdcb#_,Maude V.

Only by a happy chance can I reckon myself amongst the few who have lately heard LISZT play. I happened to be staying in Rome, and LISZT kindly invited me over to the Villa d'Este twice. There at Tivoli, alone with him, he conversed with me of the times long gone by of MENDELSSOHN, of PAGANINI, of CHOPIN. There in the warm light of an Italian autumn, subdued by the dark-red curtains that hung in his study, with an old-world silence around us, he sat at his piano once more; and as he played to me the clock of time went back, and CHOPIN entered with his pale refined face, his slight aristo- cratic figure: HEINE sat restlessly in a dark corner; 39 610 LISZT. MADAME SAND reclined in the deep window-niche overlooking the desolate Campagna, with Rome in the distance; DE LAMMENAIS stood at the foot of the piano a delicate, yet sinewy and mobile frame with his noble eager face all aglow, his eloquent tongue silent, listening to the inspiration of another believer in another evangelium the evangeliura of the emotions, the Gospel of Art. Shadows all of you, yet to me for an hour, in the deep solitude of the great Cardinal's palace alone with LISZT, more real than the men and women of our lesser day. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ",18Ll-uu-uu,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/018c7131fa6360859fb7a7b2b1a27e2a,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/67f48a8d33787aef77cb09800bd4039c/1438002676246,Indoor Solitary Domestic,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hugh_Reginald_Haweis,Hugh Reginald Haweis,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Piano,

The fortunes of Italian opera were now at their lowest ebb. The season of 1885 had been almost wholly barren, and that of 1886 was little better. Incapacity and indifference reached their climax with the disgraceful and humiliating scene that occurred at Her Majesty's Theatre on the night of March 6, 1886. Some unknown person, evidently without experience as a manager, had there started a season of Italian opera with a company of incompetent artists. On the fourth night it completely collapsed under circumstances unprecedented in the annals of opera in a great city. I quote my own description of what occurred. 
“The second act of “Faust"" had concluded when the orchestra refused to proceed further unless their salaries were instantly paid. Their claims were partly satisfied, and, after an interval of inordinate length, in the course of which the audience displayed the noisiest impatience, the opera proceeded for another act, with the accompaniment of about half the band. But the crisis had only been deferred. After the curtain had fallen again there was another long ""wait,"" and the disturbances recommenced. At length, in response to deafening calls, the stage-manager came forward and announced that it was impossible to proceed. The stage-carpenters had refused to set the next scene, and the opera could not, therefore, go on. A howl of derision and anger greeted this statement; but the audience, having made up its mind to the worst, was preparing, amid a fearful din, to depart, when the curtain rose once more and a whole army of stage assistants came down to the footlights with outstretched arms and aprons, as though to implore the charity of the house. The gestures were understood, and, with one accord, the remaining occupants of the gallery and upper tiers began flinging a shower of coppers and small silver coins down on to the stage, uttering the while all sorts of satirical and uncomplimentary epithets. However, the occupation was too expensive to last long, and in a minute or two this disgraceful episode came to a termination, ending also a night of horrors that will never be forgotten by those who witnessed it.""",http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/day/1886-03-06,,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/483c99e147f959712940403615536f98/1438264273301,Indoor Accompanied Public,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Hermann+Klein/1438157240872,Hermann Klein,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

[…] my cousin Jack stuck to the musical profession. Two of my songs he sang really beautifully and with very great success, i.e. “To Mary,” and “A Youth once loved a Maiden.” In fact, he sang them so often that one day I said to him, laughing - “You know, Jack, they really are not the only songs I have written.”
He was engaged by Sir Henry Irving to sing “Sigh no more Ladies,” when he produced Much Ado about Nothing at the Lyceum (his mother, of course, called it “Much Ado about Nothing at all”), and the way he sang that song was certainly among the most attractive things in the performance.

It was given in a newly constructed square hall. Cavaille-Coll, who knew acoustics, used to advise the square hall for concerts but nobody would listen to him. Three hundred chorus singers, many from a distance, were supported by an orchestra that was large, but, in my opinion, insufficient to stand up against this mass of voices. Furthermore, the orchestra was placed below the level of the stage, as in a theatre, while the voices sounded freely above. Two harps, one on the east side of the stage and one on the west, saw each other from afar, a pleasingly decorative device, but as annoying to the ear as pleasing to the eye.

Two overtures were admirably played, viz.: Leonore No. 2, Beethoven, and William Tell, Rossini. The fine chorus of men’s voices added much to the interest of the concert, but the principal piece was the charming A minor Symphony No. 3, by Mendelssohn. I have often heard this magnificent production of Mendelssohn performed at home, but it is no discredit to our orchestras to say that it is quite a different thing when given with the precision of the Gewandhaus orchestra.

My next venture in the way of novelty was certainly not of so ""legitimate"" a nature, although a justification of the policy of producing any kind of excellence to stimulate curiosity is easily furnished.

Theophile Gautier, who wrote to me respecting this interesting personage, thought she would suit England: ""Elle a surtout ce qui plait en Angleterre: l'excentricite, la nouveaute, et l’originalite."" But Gautier here only expresses the ordinary French point de vue. 
Her biography, excellently written, and introduced in a treatise upon the songs of the Isle of Cuba and negro melodies in general, had been published and disseminated. Donna Maria Martinez, the ""Black Malibran,"" it was generally made known, was the child of freed negroes, had been carefully brought up and well instructed in a Spanish house, and early grounded in musical science. Wedded to a Spanish sea captain (not a ""gentleman of colour "" it may be presumed), she had suffered reverses of fortune, and had made her musical attainments avail- able by public singing. The ""Black Malibran"" figured in a new divertissement, entitled ""Les Delices du Strait,"" as ""a wandering minstrel,"" singing to the Sultana. Her Cuban, and more exclusively Spanish melodies, were full of original charm. She accompanied herself upon the guitar, of the powers of which she was evidently a mistress. Her execution was excellent; her spirit and animation were undeniable; her voice was sweet, pure, and true, although too weak for the vast arena of her Majesty's Theatre. She was vehemently applauded and encouraged. But the whole performance was ""small,"" almost to meagreness; and although it might well be regarded as a piquant musical curiosity, it failed in any real power of attraction. This black phantom flitted briefly over the stage, to disappear for ever, as a far more illustrious ""shade"" had recently done before her.",1850-uu-uu,,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/60e9947a63540772799152d31a8c2348/1438784277660,Indoor Public Accompanied,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Benjamin+Lumley/1438607277398,Benjamin Lumley,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice http://dbpedia.org/resource/Guitar,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Divertissement

The programme included Weber’s Overtures, “The Jubilee,” and “ Der Freischiitz ; ” the so-called “ Meditation ” by Bach and Gounod, operatic selections, and some pretty waltzes by Strauss. The orchestra included two harps.

In the summer of ’88, I spent a part of the season in Paris. Sivori was still alive, and, like the majority of artists who lead the lives of virtuosi, had made Paris his home. I determined to do myself the honor of calling on him, and had an opportunity to do so in company with a Boston friend who knew him well. Sivori was living on the fourth or fifth story of a very modest hotel, having a single room, with space for an upright piano and an alcove for his bed. It was a charming, cosy little room, just such a one as the majority of bachelor artists occupy in Paris, no matter how ample their income; and in these quarters they receive the visits of princes and people of the haute noblesse.
I let my friend, who was intimate with Sivori, do the talking for some time, while I watched all the artist’s motions. He was a rather small-sized man, and had very small hands for a violinist, at which I marvelled, for his distinction was based on his being a Paganini player; and we all know that the music of that composer requires the fingers of a prestidigitator. As we progressed in our call I nudged my friend (according to previous agreement) to tell Sivori I was a member of the Mendelssohn Quintette Club of Boston, and that I wanted very much to see the famous “ Strad,” the inheritance from Paganini. Sivori was amiability itself.
[…]
Sivori took out the violin from its case. It was a perfect “ Kohinoor ” of an instrument, just the right color, and perfectly preserved,— not a scratch or a crack,—with the great seal of red sealing-wax on the under part of the violin where the neck begins. I told Mr. Sivori that I heard him in his first concert given in the old Masonic Temple in Boston (where R. H. Steams &amp; Co.’s store now is), that I was an enthusiastic boy at the time, and that his playing had made such an impression on me that I could name the pieces he played in that concert, though there was an interim of about forty years. I named them,—the E-flat concerto (his own composition), La Campanile by Paga¬nini, and the Most in Egitto, also by Paganini.
The old artist opened his bookcase, took out a book containing an itinerary of musical tourndes made in his younger days, and turned at once to Boston. I had named the pieces exactly, and he was highly pleased. He played for us a great deal, and it was a joy to hear the tone of that violin; it was also impossible not to be affected by the sentiment connected with it. Paganini’s violin! the instrument of that strange and wonderful player, the wizard of the concert stage, who had conquered all musical Europe",1888-uu-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/995eccc96ace696fff9ba66c3c52c732/1449566749829,Domestic Accompanied Indoor,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Thomas+Ryan/1448997315048,Thomas Ryan,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stradivarius,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_music

Perhaps no circumstance has tended to improve our theatrical music so much as the visit of these Germans. The excellence of their performance was to be attributed to the taste and skill of the conductor. Heretofore our bands have been led and directed by the first violin, who, when difficulties occurred, desisted from playing, and, by the flourish of his bow, endeavoured to keep his troops together. On the appearance of a new opera, the person who presided at the piano-forte had the charge of the chorus, so that the two directors were often beating two different times. Besides the movement being thus tortured, the superior execution of the first violin was withdrawn at the moment it was most needed.

He and Doyle were inseparable companions, and their duets together were the delight of the gay supper-giving society in which they lived.&nbsp; The entertainments of this kind given by my joyous and social mother could, for gaiety at least, match with the best. Our small front and back drawing-rooms, as well as a little closet attached to the latter, were on such occasions distended to their utmost capacity ; and the supper-table in the small closet where people had least room was accordingly always the most merry. In the round of singing that followed these repasts my mother usually took a part, having a clear, soft voice, and singing such songs as “How sweet in the woodlands,” which was one of her greatest favourites, in a very pleasing manner.

Gilmore had engaged all the principal sopranos of Boston, constituting a “bouquet of artistic singers.” These were placed on a special raised balcony between the orchestra and the chorus, and they sang in unison the obligato parts as they occurred in the choral pieces.",180u-Ll-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boston,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/f8a127ad24bdf928f82504bb84c98e6a/1450280645409,Indoor Public Accompanied,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Thomas+Ryan/1448997315048,Thomas Ryan,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soprano http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra http://dbpedia.org/resource/Violin,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chorale

They were assisted by a pianist from Munich, Herr Speidl. The following pieces were played. 1st. Trio for pianoforte, violin and violoncello, by Beethoven, (op. 70,) by Speidl, David, and Rietz. 2d. Quartette for strings, composed by David. 3d. Variations for pianoforte, by Mendelssohn. 4th. Quartette by Beethoven, (op. 59,) performed by Dreyschock, Rongen, Hermann, and Rietz.
There are only four of these concerts in the annual series, so that they are much more rare here than in Boston. They seem not to be so popular as the concerts by full orchestra, yet they draw out a musical audience of great intelligence, and on this occasion the learned ones were there.

Verdi now offered his ""Masnadieri,"" composed upon the subject of Schiller's well-known play, ""Die Rauber,"" and with this proposal I was obliged to close. On Thursday, July 2nd, ""I Masnadieri "" (after wearying rehearsals, conducted by the composer himself), was brought out, with a cast that included Lablache, Gardoni, Coletti, Bouche, and, above all, Jenny Lind, who was to appear for the second time only in her career, in a thoroughly original part composed expressly for her. The house was filled to overflowing on the night of the first representation. The opera was given with every appearance of a triumphant success: the composer and all the singers receiving the highest honours. Indeed, all the artists distinguished themselves in their several parts. Jenny Lind acted admirably, and sang the airs allotted to her exquisitely. But yet the ""Masnadieri"" could not be considered a success. That by its production I had adopted the right course was unquestionable. I had induced an Italian composer, whose reputation stood on the highest pinnacle of continental fame, to compose an opera expressly for my theatre, as well as to superintend its production. More I could not have done to gratify the patrons of Italian music, who desired to hear new works. It may be stated, in confirmation of the judgment of the London audience, that ""I Masnadieri"" was never successful on any Italian stage. The libretto was even worse constructed than is usually the case with adaptations of foreign dramas to the purpose of Italian opera. To Her Majesty's Theatre the work was singularly ill-suited. The interest which ought to have been centred in Mademoiselle Lind was centred in Gardoni; whilst Lablache, as the imprisoned father, had to do about the only thing he could not do to perfection — having to represent a man nearly starved to death.",http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/day/1847-07-02,,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/0592c5f3f93b02c504d39671de3b254d/1438705681564,Accompanied Public Indoor,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Benjamin+Lumley/1438607277398,Benjamin Lumley,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

The band was in the most perfect order, and the programme was unusually attractive; though great variety of music, both with respect to authorship and character, is always presented to the patrons of this celebrated series of concerts. The Symphonie was by Mozart in Eb major; it is less noisy, flighty and diffuse than some more modem compositions, but not less intelligible or beautiful. The adagio is particularly melodious, elegant and attractive.
A scene and arie from “Orpheus,” by Gluck, followed. Gluck is a decided favorite here, and especially as a dramatic writer stands among the very first.
The third piece was a concerto for violin, by Beethoven, performed by Herr Concertmeister F. David. This concerto, worthy the reputation of its author, was finely rendered by the violinist, and received with a hearty applause. It is very long, but it does not tire for it is full of variety, and there is enough to admire, both in the principal and in the accompaniment. Two quite long cadenzas, composed by the performer, containing each an ingenious recapitulation of the thoughts, or rather allusion to the various figures of the movement in which the cadenza occurred, were introduced, with excellent taste and skill.
The second part of the concert consisted of “Die erste Walpurgisnacht,” a ballad by Goethe, set to music by Mendelssohn. A choir of about one hundred and fifty voices sang the choruses (and there is much chorus in the piece) with admirable promptness and energy. The music is difficult, both for vocalists and instrumentalists; it is one of Mendelssohn’s strong pieces, and is full of his peculiar harmonies. It is mostly very loud, with an abundance of instruments of noise, and extra double drums for earthquake, volcano, and thunder; though there is most acceptable relief in occasional piano passages. Although Mendelssohn does not belong to the noisy school, yet he has shown in the Walpurgisnacht, that if he had chosen to do so he might have cast quite into the shade, or thundered out of existence, all the Verdis of modern times.",1852-03-Mm,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/0a19459865ed69275723d6efb76048c9,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/159cd313ab52e280064217252efab632/1448285723790,Accompanied Public Indoor,http://musicbrainz.org/artist/f422b99a-b48c-4bee-bc0c-f2e8cad82b6c#_,Dr. Lowell Mason Lowell Mason,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

There was no processional hymn, the organist playing, whilst the clergy and choir took their places, a soft voluntary by Archer. The confession was monotoned throughout, the more modern pretty cadences, which were permitted to be sung for some years, being now, happily, excluded. The whole of the versicles, etc., were the beautiful and time-honoured work of Tallis. The Venite was sung to a single chant by Nares, and the Psalms for the day to a double chant in A minor and major by Battishill. I very much doubt if the major adaptation of this chant was written by Battishill, any more than was the chord of the six-four preceding the tonic at the end of the second phrase. A fine effect has always been obtained at the Parish Church by the basses alone giving out, in impressive unison, the first half of the chant, the second half being followed by the full choir. It might, perhaps, have been an improvement if there had been a little more variety of expression and power in the chanting of the Psalms, in every verse of which there lies a u point to seize,” and the perception of this point will give a feeling in the rendition which will be taken as coming from the heart, although, in fact, it may be only from the lips. The choir, I venture to think, stand as precentors to the congregation, and their delivery of the poetry of the Psalms will govern the delivery of the congregation. Every syllable should be distinctly uttered—no gabble, no hurry. It would be as well that every church choir should have a master in this phonic science, in order that the Psalms shall be chanted in rythmical rule—every verse, in fact, marked out as to its harmonious form in language. I need not say how gratifying it was to me to hear the service of my lifelong friend, the late Henry Smart, sung with such power and expression. Of this work I may perhaps be permitted to repeat, what I have said elsewhere, that it is agreed by the most eminent church musicians there is nothing more complete or beautiful of its class in the whole range of music, and nothing, indeed, can be more plain or straightforward, and at the same time more appropriate to the words of the grand Ambrosian hymn than the opening phrases, “ We praise Thee, O God ; we acknowledge Thee to be the Lord"". For dignity, power, and a grand conception of the text we must go on to that part of the Te Deum commencing, “ When Thou tookest upon Thee to deliver man.” The manner in which this sublime passage is built up, rising chord upon chord with rich and flowing music, seems as if it would never stop until it reached the gates of heaven itself. It would, I think, be an improvement, of which the composer himself approved, if the closing phrase of this sublime Te Deum were sung slower and very piano, instead of in strict and unrelenting time. Smart’s Te Deum is a pattern in plan and execution. It has served to create an emulative feeling, to open new fountains, and to justify and encourage freedom in form, and a strong exhibition of individual spirit. The Creed of St. Athanasius was sung to Tallis’s old two-note chant, consisting of C and B only in the melody, and this becomes somewhat monotonous unless a great power of tone and expression be given to certain passages of the text, especially at the words, “ but One God,” etc., which is greatly enhanced by a slow and deliberate accentuation. The “Introit” (which formerly was an antiphone sung while the priest proceeded to the altar to celebrate Mass), was, “ How lovely are the messengers,” from Mendelssohn’s St. Paul and the “Anthem,” an extract from Spohr’s Last Judgment, “ And lo! a throne,” etc. Both of these were sung with good taste, and in the latter the beautiful voice of Mr. Blagbro was heard to great advantage in the solos. It would, perhaps, have been more satisfactory if one of the anthems had been by an English composer, and surely there could have been no difficulty in finding such a work. The only hymn sung was, “ Holy, Holy, Holy,” to Dykes’s well-known tune Trinity, in which the congregation joined with great devotional fervour. The Post Communion Service was Tours in F, and, excellent as it is in its way, I could not help regretting that Smart’s magnificent setting was not taken so as to have continued his services throughout the day. The whole of this important part of the service, especially the unaccompanied responses and hymn, exhibited in the highest degree the efficiency of the choir. It has been truly said that the high choir service of our Church was made out of the office of Morning Prayer. The Communion office or Mass is, of course, the high musical service in the Latin Church ; but our English Communion office, until within these few years, was a sober, secret, and almost somniferous celebration, without choir, and almost without communicants. And so it is now in too many of our local churches. But more of this hereafter.
The service was concluded with what is known as Stainer’s ""Amen,” introduced first in St. Paul’s Cathedral, for which it was specially written. It contains some fine harmonical progressions, and is undoubtedly very cleverly put together, but there are two bars therein so very much like one of Palestrina’s celebrated works as would almost cause me to mistake one for the other. During the departure of the congregation, Dr. Creser played an expressive little voluntary on the sweet stops of the echo and choir organs, which were, I believe, voiced by Schulze himself.
On special occasions—Christmastide and Lent—oratorios are given in the Parish Church with increased musical resources, and greatly, I am persuaded, to the religious edification of those who attend them. Listening to an oratorio or an anthem is no direct act of worship, whether in or out of a church, nor is listening to a sermon ; but the hearing of an oratorio is, with that of hearing a sermon, a religious act, and commonly a much more profitable and instructive employment of time.
&nbsp;I will conclude this notice by observing that all church music should be of so exalted a character as will delight the genuine composer, exhilarate the organist and singers, and stimulate each and all to exert their utmost abilities for the attainment of a musical service as faultless as possible.",187u-Ll-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leeds,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/70c5273b2e8611f1bea07381aaa693f5/1469632086135,Public Indoor Accompanied,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Dr+William+Spark/1465384918944,Dr William Spark,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_music

The result was that neither “Carmen” nor “Esmeralda” appeared in its Gallic guise until late in July. Indeed, “Carmen” was given only for Harris's “benefit"" on the very last night of the season, &nbsp;when the demand for seats was so enormous that &nbsp;stalls sold for £4 ($20) apiece, and many hundreds of people were turned away from the doors. &nbsp;The only disappointment was Melba's non-apppearance as Michaela, but this was almost &nbsp;forgotten amid the triumphs of Jean de Reszke &nbsp;and Lassalle, whose admirable impersonations &nbsp;were well matched by the fascinating Carmen of Zelie de Lussan. Being a kind of gala night, Augustus Harris imagined it would be interesting to &nbsp;have each of his three conductors engaged upon &nbsp;the one opera.

Such a light as LISZT'S could not be long hid; all Vienna in 1822 was talking of the wonderful boy. ""Est deus in nobis,"" wrote the papers rather profanely. The ""little Hercules,"" the ""young giant,"" the boy ""virtuoso from the clouds”, were amongst the epithets coined to celebrate his marvellous rendering of HUMMEL’S ""Concerto in A"" and a free ""Fantasia"" of his own.

Sontag, by marriage the Countess Rossi. The weather was unfavorable, being rainy, and the streets were muddy. I took my place at the door of the Gewandhaus at half-past four, where the people were then gathering. By five, when the outer door was opened, a multitude had assembled, and immediately rushed into the house, filling the long stairway and entry. Here was another interval of waiting, until half-past five, when the door of the hall was opened, and the room was immediately filled. We had now to wait another hour, or until half-past six; when the performance commenced with a Symphonie, by Joseph Hadyn in C, very light, playful, and pleasing, but lacking the depth of a Beethoven or a Mendelssohn. It is so easy a composition, that it seemed to be quite children’s play for the orchestra, who yet rendered it in the most perfect manner possible. This was followed by an Arie from “Rinaldo” by Handel; a most charming song indeed, and as charmingly sung by Mad. Sontag. Of Mad. Sontag’s singing, I dare not speak now. I will only say that no one can have a more perfect execution; but to say in what her excellence consists, as a singer, or what are the peculiarities of her style, must not now be attempted.
The third piece was “Romanze for the Violin,” by Beethoven; performed by Herr Concertmeister, Ferdinand David. This is the David whose compositions for the violin are so well known, and whose reputation as a player is so extensive. Mad. Sontag then sang ""Bel raggio lusinghier,"" from Rossini’s Semiramide, a song requiring the greatest powers of vocalization; this was perfectly given by the inimitable artist.
The second part consisted of the Overture and a long scene from Gluck’s famous “Iphigenie in Tauride;"" the principal vocal part being that of Iphigenie by Mad. Sontag. Gluck has not been heard with us, but he ranks in the very first class of composers here. The overture is a magnificent concert piece, and it was performed by this fine orchestra with wonderful precision and effect. Beethoven’s Overture to Egmont closed the musical entertainments of the evening, and well repaid one for his Two Thalers, (cost of a ticket,) and for all the previous waiting, wetting, and crowding necessary to secure a place to stand up.",1852-02-Mm,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/0a19459865ed69275723d6efb76048c9,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/88a9e0eea6c895faabba21e4dc583c21/1448279043502,Indoor Public Accompanied,http://musicbrainz.org/artist/f422b99a-b48c-4bee-bc0c-f2e8cad82b6c#_,Dr. Lowell Mason Lowell Mason,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Overture

But one piece was sung, and that was a new composition by Robert Schumann, “Der Rose Pilgerfahrt” (Pilgrimage of the Rose,) an allegory by M. Horn, to which Schumann has written music. The choir consisted of about one hundred voices, well balanced as to the parts, with an efficient orchestra; the whole directed by the Concertmeister David.
The music is mostly solo, though some fine chorus effects are produced, especially in a funeral scene, the “burial of a miller’s daughter.” It is, throughout, highly scientific or learned, and of course difficult. A very fine musician, Mr. Richter, teacher of harmony and instrumentation in the conservatory, who was sitting beside me, said, “Robert Schumann is truly a great composer, but his music must be studied, and heard more than once, to be appreciated; we cannot understand it at the first hearing.” His opera, “Genoveva,” failed — it is too learned, and is now seldom performed. He writes for the musicians rather than for the people.",1852-03-Mm,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/0a19459865ed69275723d6efb76048c9,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/88d5b41643d275be8818ae38455b87e3/1448286850263,Public Indoor Accompanied,http://musicbrainz.org/artist/f422b99a-b48c-4bee-bc0c-f2e8cad82b6c#_,Dr. Lowell Mason Lowell Mason,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra http://dbpedia.org/resource/Choir,

Two of my songs he sang really beautifully and with very great success, i.e. “To Mary,” and “A Youth once loved a Maiden.” In fact, he sang them so often that one day I said to him, laughing - “You know, Jack, they really are not the only songs I have written.”
He was engaged by Sir Henry Irving to sing “Sigh no more Ladies,” when he produced Much Ado about Nothing at the Lyceum (his mother, of course, called it “Much Ado about Nothing at all”), and the way he sang that song was certainly among the most attractive things in the performance. Although as Balthazar he had to call himself “an ill singer,” the moment he had finished the last note I am quite certain that very few people in the house were ever found to agree with him.",187u-Mm-uu,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/ce6dcd9f30bf82ec34c4646a94f86c32,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/2566162f784a8aaaf7ee655b67e3a689/1450887134241,Indoor Accompanied Public,http://musicbrainz.org/artist/eca4d562-1e5c-409a-89fa-5489d102cdcb#_,Maude V.

The French Opera is the most splendid theatre in Paris; but protect me from French singing!—especially if it be serious singing. Arthur Young, in speaking of French singing, describes it as ""the distortions of embodied dissonance,"" and Rousseau inveighs against the ""lamentable chant Français"" as bearing more resemblance ""aux cris de la colique qu'aux transports des passions;"" and in their choruses there is a grand roar-royal, as if they all had the colic together. The light airs of their comic operas are however very pleasing; and there is at least this merit in their singing, that you can hear what they say. The airs of Gretry are delightful.

They are held in a somewhat smaller room, and at a small subscription price, and are given only once in two weeks. The orchestra consists of about sixty talented musicians, and if Dreyschock and David are not seen leading the violins here as at the Gewandhaus, they, together with the other instruments, string and wind, are in the hands of artists of deservedly high reputation. The selections are also of the highest order, and the Euterpe presents its patrons with the works of the great masters in a style worthy of a Leipzig concert.
At a quarter of an hour before the time of commencement, the members of the orchestra were in their places, talking, tuning and getting ready. This, together with the general conversation of the people assembled, produces a buzzing chorus of great power — a chorus with which the Leipzig concerts commence. Every ticket was sold at an early hour, and of course every seat was occupied.
The concert commenced precisely at the hour appointed, with a new Sinfonie in E flat Major, in manuscript, by W. Westmayer, who conducted the performance. He is a young candidate for fame, who has been educated at the Conservatory here, and who is regarded as already a successful composer. The Sinfonie consisted of four parts, and occupied in its performance exactly thirty-eight minutes. I dare not attempt anything like a particular description of it, or comparison of it with other like compositions; it was listened to with good attention by a discriminating audience, and met a favorable reception. It seemed to me, however, to want light and shade, and variety in the treatment of the different subjects introduced. Parts of it were exceedingly interesting, considered in reference to modern combinations and contrasts of the different orchestral elements, but there was a too constant forte, and a too frequent reiteration of the tonic and dominant harmony, with brass instruments, in military rhythm — this, indeed, is a general resort of such composers as are sometimes at a loss for an idea, or in a similar condition with the public speaker who is obliged to speak, but has nothing in particular to say. I do not mean that Mr. Westmayer was minus thought, but still there was not such a flow as we often find in a Mozart.
The Sinfonie was truly good, and seemed to give much satisfaction — and yet I could not help thinking that it was an excellent preparation for the high appreciation of the next orchestral piece, which was no less an overture than the celebrated No. 2, C Major, to Leonore, and which was given with an effect far beyond what can be often heard.
The overture by C. M. Von Weber, to Oberon, was also played with such an energy and brilliancy as to take one’s breath away. The stillness of the pianos, the gradual and immense range of the crescendos, the thundering power of the fortes, with instantaneous contrasts and startling sfortzandos, were enough to work up the feelings to a perfect phrenzy. Wonderfully effective were these ever favorite overtures by Beethoven and Weber.
It was no small attraction of this concert that the piano forte was played by the Fraulein Maria Wieck, the sister of the celebrated Clara, wife of Robert Schumann. Mdlle. Wieck is a very superior player; she has not the strong hand of a DeMeyer or a Listz, but she has a most finished touch, and plays with great elegance and expression. Her first piece (hear it, oh ye of the exclusive modern school,) was nothing more nor less than Dussek’s 12th Concerto in E fiat major, the Adagio and Allegro movements of which she played — a most beautiful composition, elegant and tasteful in the highest degree, played both by the principal and by the orchestra as near perfection as such things can be done. There is nothing in the music to astonish, or to excite wonder or surprise, but there is that in it which is adapted to call forth perfect delight. It is full of peace, and innocence, and purity, and joy, and it is from beginning to end a constant appeal to the perception of the beautiful. I am no enemy to the modem school; it is indispensable to an accomplished pianist, and every well-educated musician will delight in it; but they err who suppose that in Clementi and Cramer and Dussek and Pleyel, there is nothing good or worth being saved. The fact is, the pianists, previous to him who is generally regarded as the head of the great modern school, had worked out a very satisfactory solution of the problem of piano forte playing, or certainly so if considered with reference to the more natural and legitimate powers of the instrument. Thaiberg, Listz, and others, have certainly much enlarged the boundaries, or the available capacities of the piano, but some of their followers have gone to extremes; so much so that there has seemed to be danger of losing altogether the ordinary effects of piano forte playing, or that they would he swallowed up in the extraordinary feats of left-hand melodies, flights of octaves, and the various methods by which amazement and wonder are excited. Thanks for the signs of returning soberness and good sense; we greatly mistake if other authors like Dussek are not yet to be brought back to the concert room, and to the parlor, to fill with delight the spirit of the true lover of music, and of the most beautiful of all keyed instruments, the piano forte.
A word to another class. There are some who condemn altogether the modern school, and who seem to suppose that all true musical genius left the world with Haydn and those of his day. Fraulein Wieck is not of their number, for while she played Dussek, in the first part of the concert, she played not Thalberg, or Listz, or DeMeyer in the second part, but Pagannini! Yes, the Carnival of Venice, arranged for the piano, and if music pleased legitimately in Dussek, the Fraulein excited no small degree of feeling by her exquisite touch, and facility of execution in the composition of the Prince of violinists. What if it be mere trickery; a dexterous artifice will always, at least, call forth admiration, and one does not always want to sit in sober judgment; and decide on the grounds of intrinsic musical merit — relaxation must be indulged, the beautiful give way to the ornamental, and true pleasure to mere amusement. If there is a time for all things, surely there is room enough for the old and new school of piano forte playing — yes, and for both schools of organ playing too, although this is not the place to dwell upon the latter.
There was still another interesting feature in the Euterpe&nbsp;Concert — it was the singing of Mdlle. Louise Wolfl. She sang an air from Stradella by Flotow, and also two German songs, the latter by Franz Schubert. A pretty singer, but not superior to several American vocalists.",1852-01-Mm,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leipzig,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/c0042dd7840965b71fd34971022633c0/1448276576369,Public Accompanied Indoor,http://musicbrainz.org/artist/f422b99a-b48c-4bee-bc0c-f2e8cad82b6c#_,Dr. Lowell Mason Lowell Mason,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Symphony

While I was yet quite a child, my father happened to have an old lumbering harpsichord thrown on his hands, as part payment of a debt from some bankrupt customer; and when I was a little older, my mother, anxious to try my faculties in all possible ways, employed a youth who was in the service of a tuner in our neighbourhood, to teach me to play. My instructor, however, being young himself, was a good deal more given to romping and jumping than to music, and our time together was chiefly passed in vaulting over the tables and chairs of the drawing-room. The progress I made, therefore, was not such as to induce my mother to continue me in this instruction; and I left off, after acquiring little more than the power of playing two or three tunes with the right hand only. It was soon, however, discovered that I had an agreeable voice and taste for singing; and in the sort of gay life we led (for my mother was always fond of society), this talent of mine was frequently called into play to enliven our tea-parties and suppers. In the summer theatricals too, which I have already recorded, my singing of the songs of Patrick, in the Poor Soldier, —particularly of the duet with Norah, into which I threw a feeling far beyond my years,— was received with but too encouraging applause.",http://data.open.ac.uk/time/interval/178u-uu-uu/to/17uu-Ee-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dublin,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/3010fc7fc277517e66e7315e0cb8e566/1558349184216,Domestic Indoor Accompanied,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Mrs+Anastasia+Moore/1558351429206 http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Guests+of+Anastasia+Moore/1558351443455,Anastasia Jane Moore Guests of Anastasia Moore,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Female_vocals http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice http://dbpedia.org/resource/Male_vocals,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

The musicians were a splendid set. He had Bottesini, the Paganini of the contrabass, and Koenig, the great cornetist of the day, who could play with wonderful expression, his rendition of the Prima Donna Waltz being really an artistic marvel. Then there was the oboist, Lavigne, playing with exquisite tone and fine technique, who could hold a tone (it was said) all the evening by breathing through his nostrils while playing. Then there was the necromantic flautist, Reichardt, the very fine clarinetist, Wuille, and an ophicleide- player, Mr. Hughes, who drew out of his instrument a wonderfully soft, large, and mellow tone, and played with great execution.

Our first business was to find Signor Mancinelli. He lived in a house overlooking some public gardens not far from the royal palace, and on the way thither Harris confided to me for the first time that he was not quite sure whether he ought to have engaged the man we were then going to see, or his brother, Marino Mancinelli, who was the conductor at the Lisbon Opera-house, and, according to some people, the more gifted of the two. On this point I was happily able to reassure my friend. I had not seen both brothers ; but, when at Bologna in 1879, I had seen Luigi Mancinelli direct at the Teatro Comunale a remarkably fine performance of Gounod's “Faust"" (with a Covent Garden soprano. Mlle. Turolla, as Margherita), and I had considered him a chef-d^orchestre of the first order. Harris was able quickly to confirm this opinion for himself by means of a representation of the selfsame work at the Royal Opera-house. &nbsp;&nbsp;",1879-uu-uu,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/09114a766689f030e7779fad72ef471b,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/b583782b21ae5c9eabb6f7382439af23/1438423260241,Accompanied Public Indoor,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Hermann+Klein/1438157240872,Hermann Klein,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

In spite of the dreadful sentimentality of the words - perhaps for that very reason - the song had an unqualified success. It was loudly encored, and both the singer and I stepped off the platform highly pleased with each other. I had never written anything the least like it.

I shall never forget one concert that was given at Epsom, near Kennerley-Rumford’s home. I had been miserably unwell for a very long time. My friends were always urging me to take a rest, or go abroad, but a composer is, in most cases, anything but a millionaire, and my one answer was, “I simply can’t afford it.” When I received a letter from Bertie Rumford, asking me if I would accompany Harry Greene and himself in a number of my songs at Epsom, I was feeling really ill, but I was so fond of them both that I felt I simply couldn’t refuse. And I went from Broadway to Epsom and played a solo and helped with the accompaniments. I was putting on my cloak in the artists’ room at the end of the concert when Harry came up to me. He said excitedly -
“Just you go and give Bertie Rumford the biggest hug you ever gave any one in all your life !”
I said, “Good gracious ! Why ?”
“Why ?” he cried; “because it’s been your concert, because you’ve been ill, and because he wants this very minute to hand you over the whole of the proceeds.”
I could have cried my eyes out when he told me this; it was so absolutely and utterly unexpected, and the kindness and delicacy with which the whole thing had been arranged bowled me completely over.",http://data.open.ac.uk/time/interval/1896-uu-uu/to/190u-Ee-uu,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/6e79df7b84df13b264820d92df9c58a8,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/2bb873f79fd9c514394316dfe504d718/1452342123022,Indoor Accompanied Domestic,http://musicbrainz.org/artist/eca4d562-1e5c-409a-89fa-5489d102cdcb#_,Maude V.

It was at a popular chapel attached to a large establishment where poor children are cared for and protected, and which is much visited by strangers coming to London. Here the organ-playing is frivolous, light and trifling, we had almost said, as is Jullien's Quadrille Orchestra in Drury Lane. It is amazing that any one who has musical knowledge should so pervert the powers of his instrument. But yet the&nbsp;organist has fine powers of execution; he plays with a rapidity of finger, with a clean piano-forte touch, producing the staccato with as much distinctness as stringed instruments, and at times&nbsp;almost the pizzicato. So it was on the occasion when we last heard him, when the song, ""Why do the nations,"" from the Messiah, with the chorus, ""Let us break their bands,"" were sung to an organ accompaniment as brilliant almost as that of a grand orchestra.&nbsp;

En route, after a voyage of fourteen days, we stopped at Honolulu. It had been arranged for us to give a concert in that city if circumstances permitted. When our ship was approaching the shore, on June 5, 1882, but was still about two miles from the wharf, a fleet of small boats came out to meet friends, and from one of them came the questions, “ Is the Quintette Club on board ? Are they ready to give the concert ?” To which we joyfully replied, “Yes.” Thereupon, the boat signaled &nbsp;the wharf, and the news was sent to the telephone office. Thence it was promptly speeded round the city, reserved seats were taken with a rush, and we had a fine audience. Nearly all the passengers on our ship, 250 in number, were present, as well as the best society in the place, including King Kalakaua and his court, crowding the boxes of the opera house. After the concert we were feted by a German society at their club-rooms, where we “ made a night of it,” until it was time for the ship to sail, early next morning.",188u-uu-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Honolulu,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/aaa79c0d46160bb4a4021386c7bf976c/1449480241010,Indoor Accompanied Public,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Thomas+Ryan/1448997315048,Thomas Ryan,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clarinet http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soprano http://dbpedia.org/resource/Viola http://dbpedia.org/resource/Female_vocals http://dbpedia.org/resource/Violin http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flute,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_music

A right royal musical evening it was, shared by about fifty artist and amateur guests. We made much music,—beginning with Rubinstein’s String Quintette in F, op. 57. Then we had the Rasoumoffski Quartette in F, op. 57, by Beethoven, with Wieniawski playing first violin. Then the Schumann Piano Quintette, with Rubinstein at the piano. Oh, it was a joy to take part with such a man and in such a work! and how Rubinstein did spur us on by his passionate way of playing some of the great parts! his power was fierce and tremendous. I think we all revelled in the sea of sound we made about us.
After the Quintette, Rubinstein played a lot of choice solo pieces, ending the evening with the Chopin Polonaise in A flat, op. 53, in which comes the wonderful passage for the left hand in octaves. He began the phrase very soft, then the “little-by-little crescendo” was most admirably done, finally reaching a fortissimo power which was quite colossal. It stirred us all up, and set even the chandelier to jingling in sympathy, and possibly in admiration.",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boston,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/281deaa83d3a533108cf58af62acfd5c/1449477694430,Domestic Indoor Accompanied,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Thomas+Ryan/1448997315048,Thomas Ryan,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Piano,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_music

I had no lessons, but was sent to practise by myself for an hour every afternoon on a horrid little upright piano in the dreary dining-room.
&nbsp;
Of course I did nothing of the sort; in the first place, I had nothing to practise, for I certainly had no intention of learning any of the really dreadful drawing-room pieces with which the piano was covered. Occasionally I played through one of them, for I read music quite easily. How I jibbed at the “Prière d’une Vierge”! The “Gems of Scotland,” set in arpeggios and triplets, were sham jewels for which I had unmitigated contempt, and one or two pieces by Brinsley Richards made my flesh creep. I had such frightful attacks of low spirits in that dreary back room that I never think of it without horror. After some months I began to connect music itself with those four walls and those hideous tenth-rate compositions which lay in bilious green and yellow covers on the top of the piano, and it seemed to me that my own love of music was being slowly poisoned to death. So much for atmosphere! When I left Miss Reach’s at the end of the year, I would not have cared if I had never set eyes on a piano again. I almost hated the sight of one.

We had a good house and a crowded gallery. In the latter two men were seated on the right- hand side near the stage, who, when we began the closing piece, attempted to get out. They&nbsp; had to walk down one side of the hall, then across the end, then up the other side, before reaching the door, which was the only means of ingress or egress to the gallery—an awful fire-trap. We began the introduction to the overture. At this point, up rose the two men and started for the door. We stopped playing. The silence told the men that something had happened, and they sat down again, probably not wishing to make a show of themselves by walking out, in their number elevens, without music. All being quiet, we began the opening phrase once more; up rose again the two men and began their march. Again we stopped, wishing to let them get out and not have our piece spoiled; and again they stood still, this time in the aisle next the wall. We waited a little, and hearing no noise we began for the third time. Instantly, one of the men, who at this point had probably “ got his mad up,"" started for the door. With him it was “ Pike’s Peak or bust ” this time. When we heard the noise we stopped again, whereupon the audience began to titter, and the man making for the door ran the gauntlet of many ironical remarks from the boys, such as, “Take your time, old fellow,”—“No hurry,”—“He’ll get there,”—“ The fiddles ’ll wait,” etc. Finally he reached the door and slammed it with all his might, a parting benediction which, as a reverend friend afterward remarked, said “ Damn! ” as surely as a word could be translated into action. The entire audience understood it in that sense and burst into a perfect roar of laughter.

They are held in a somewhat smaller room, and at a small subscription price, and are given only once in two weeks. The orchestra consists of about sixty talented musicians, and if Dreyschock and David are not seen leading the violins here as at the Gewandhaus, they, together with the other instruments, string and wind, are in the hands of artists of deservedly high reputation. The selections are also of the highest order, and the Euterpe presents its patrons with the works of the great masters in a style worthy of a Leipzig concert.
At a quarter of an hour before the time of commencement, the members of the orchestra were in their places, talking, tuning and getting ready. This, together with the general conversation of the people assembled, produces a buzzing chorus of great power — a chorus with which the Leipzig concerts commence. Every ticket was sold at an early hour, and of course every seat was occupied.
The concert commenced precisely at the hour appointed, with a new Sinfonie in E flat Major, in manuscript, by W. Westmayer, who conducted the performance. He is a young candidate for fame, who has been educated at the Conservatory here, and who is regarded as already a successful composer. The Sinfonie consisted of four parts, and occupied in its performance exactly thirty-eight minutes. I dare not attempt anything like a particular description of it, or comparison of it with other like compositions; it was listened to with good attention by a discriminating audience, and met a favorable reception. It seemed to me, however, to want light and shade, and variety in the treatment of the different subjects introduced. Parts of it were exceedingly interesting, considered in reference to modern combinations and contrasts of the different orchestral elements, but there was a too constant forte, and a too frequent reiteration of the tonic and dominant harmony, with brass instruments, in military rhythm — this, indeed, is a general resort of such composers as are sometimes at a loss for an idea, or in a similar condition with the public speaker who is obliged to speak, but has nothing in particular to say. I do not mean that Mr. Westmayer was minus thought, but still there was not such a flow as we often find in a Mozart.
The Sinfonie was truly good, and seemed to give much satisfaction — and yet I could not help thinking that it was an excellent preparation for the high appreciation of the next orchestral piece, which was no less an overture than the celebrated No. 2, C Major, to Leonore, and which was given with an effect far beyond what can be often heard.
The overture by C. M. Von Weber, to Oberon, was also played with such an energy and brilliancy as to take one’s breath away. The stillness of the pianos, the gradual and immense range of the crescendos, the thundering power of the fortes, with instantaneous contrasts and startling sfortzandos, were enough to work up the feelings to a perfect phrenzy. Wonderfully effective were these ever favorite overtures by Beethoven and Weber.
It was no small attraction of this concert that the piano forte was played by the Fraulein Maria Wieck, the sister of the celebrated Clara, wife of Robert Schumann. Mdlle. Wieck is a very superior player; she has not the strong hand of a DeMeyer or a Listz, but she has a most finished touch, and plays with great elegance and expression. Her first piece (hear it, oh ye of the exclusive modern school,) was nothing more nor less than Dussek’s 12th Concerto in E fiat major, the Adagio and Allegro movements of which she played — a most beautiful composition, elegant and tasteful in the highest degree, played both by the principal and by the orchestra as near perfection as such things can be done. There is nothing in the music to astonish, or to excite wonder or surprise, but there is that in it which is adapted to call forth perfect delight. It is full of peace, and innocence, and purity, and joy, and it is from beginning to end a constant appeal to the perception of the beautiful. I am no enemy to the modem school; it is indispensable to an accomplished pianist, and every well-educated musician will delight in it; but they err who suppose that in Clementi and Cramer and Dussek and Pleyel, there is nothing good or worth being saved. The fact is, the pianists, previous to him who is generally regarded as the head of the great modern school, had worked out a very satisfactory solution of the problem of piano forte playing, or certainly so if considered with reference to the more natural and legitimate powers of the instrument. Thaiberg, Listz, and others, have certainly much enlarged the boundaries, or the available capacities of the piano, but some of their followers have gone to extremes; so much so that there has seemed to be danger of losing altogether the ordinary effects of piano forte playing, or that they would he swallowed up in the extraordinary feats of left-hand melodies, flights of octaves, and the various methods by which amazement and wonder are excited. Thanks for the signs of returning soberness and good sense; we greatly mistake if other authors like Dussek are not yet to be brought back to the concert room, and to the parlor, to fill with delight the spirit of the true lover of music, and of the most beautiful of all keyed instruments, the piano forte.
A word to another class. There are some who condemn altogether the modern school, and who seem to suppose that all true musical genius left the world with Haydn and those of his day. Fraulein Wieck is not of their number, for while she played Dussek, in the first part of the concert, she played not Thalberg, or Listz, or DeMeyer in the second part, but Pagannini! Yes, the Carnival of Venice, arranged for the piano, and if music pleased legitimately in Dussek, the Fraulein excited no small degree of feeling by her exquisite touch, and facility of execution in the composition of the Prince of violinists. What if it be mere trickery; a dexterous artifice will always, at least, call forth admiration, and one does not always want to sit in sober judgment; and decide on the grounds of intrinsic musical merit — relaxation must be indulged, the beautiful give way to the ornamental, and true pleasure to mere amusement. If there is a time for all things, surely there is room enough for the old and new school of piano forte playing — yes, and for both schools of organ playing too, although this is not the place to dwell upon the latter.
There was still another interesting feature in the Euterpe&nbsp;Concert — it was the singing of Mdlle. Louise Wolfl. She sang an air from Stradella by Flotow, and also two German songs, the latter by Franz Schubert. A pretty singer, but not superior to several American vocalists.",1852-01-Mm,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leipzig,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/c6a8b90357ae02abacdb523280bf213d/1448276710621,Public Accompanied Indoor,http://musicbrainz.org/artist/f422b99a-b48c-4bee-bc0c-f2e8cad82b6c#_,Dr. Lowell Mason Lowell Mason,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Overture

At this period it was the custom to give a preliminary opera season before Easter, during which the great ""stars,"" who were then ordinarily engaged in Paris, Seldom appeared; inferior, or, at all events, less well-known artists, being usually engaged. This was a sort of foretaste of the richer banquet to be given when the Lenten season was over, and was generally supposed to be less relished than the post-Easter entertainment. The season of 1842, in obedience to this custom, opened on Saturday, the 12th April, with the ""Gemma di Vergy"" of Donizetti, Madame Moltini appearing for the first time as the prima donna, and Guasco as leading tenor. The choice of the opera, given rather to meet the views of the singers than those of the manager, was by no means felicitous. ""Gemma di Vergy,"" although abounding in melody and effects, both dramatic and musical, was not esteemed one of Donizetti's finer compositions, albeit a favourite opera in many parts of Italy. Donizetti, likewise, had found, up to this time, but slight favour with the English public, or, at all events, with the English press. He occupied, then, in this country, a position similar to that which afterwards fell to the lot of his successor, Verdi; and even among a great portion of the numerous critics, amateurs as well as ""professionals,"" he was pronounced, by many arbiters of taste, ""flimsy,"" ""meretricious,"" ""noisy,"" ""unsound,"" ""plagiarist,"" and so on. ""Gemma"" was unquestionably a failure; as, indeed, it would have proved under these prejudices with even stronger claims to approbation.",http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/day/1842-04-12,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Her_Majesty's_Theatre,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/e24799b723d5048066843039dd72899f/1438607456790,Accompanied Indoor Public,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Benjamin+Lumley/1438607277398,Benjamin Lumley,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

1. Quintet, G minor, Mozart.

Here was a programme worth one’s attention, whether the compositions, or the performers be considered. It was interesting to see such artists taking subordinate parts, that the compositions might be as perfectly rendered as possible. It is needless to add that the result did not disappoint expectation. This was the last concert of the Union for the season. Sixteen performances have been given; eight evening concerts, and eight subscription matinees. The Union have secured the very best artists; and three Italians, two Hungarians, two Bohemians, two Belgians, one Bavarian, three Prussians, one Austrian, one Frenchman, and five Englishmen, have been employed.

He had with him his two sons ; and our trading affair being ended, hearing that I was fond of music, he informed me they were violin-players, and proposed to have a trio of Beethoven's in the evening. It was at the Angel Inn that I met them. The father, a large stout man, had a force and breadth of play, a grandeur of style, surpassing everything I had hitherto heard upon the violin [...] His love of music led him to carry his son Francis to Paris, and to place him under Cherubini, to be educated in the musical profession. Henry, who was in business with the father, had been tutored by him upon the violoncello, and was a most accomplished performer. The style of Francis was very different from that of the father ; full of passion, exquisitely neat and delicate. In the 57th quartett of Haydn, the elder Femy impressed a force and brilliancy upon the first bar that was like the rushing of a sky-rocket into the ethereal expanse ; even Yanewick, with all his boldness, would have appeared feeble in his presence. Their combined talents were most skilfully shown in Beethoven's serenade trio; the father playing the tenor, Francis the first, and Henry the bass.

On the 29th of June, for the benefit of Lablache, I produced ""Don Pasquale."" Grisi, Mario, Fornasari, and Lablache afforded an admirable quatuor for the performance of this genial opera buffa, the success of which was perhaps even greater than that of ""Linda."" I might now indeed deem myself fortunate, for bringing out in one season two new operas, each of which won such golden opinions. Warned by this second success, the press now grew lavish in their praise of Donizetti. He was declared to have composed his Parisian opera in his ""happiest vein."" It was studded with ""musical beauties,"" and contained ""more marks of originality that most of his works,"" &amp;c., &amp;c. In fact, the tide not only changed, but now flowed strongly in favour of the once despised composer. The racy comic humour of Lablache, and the spirit of Grisi, combined with the pleasant and careful execution of Mario and Fornasari, may have contributed sensibly to a success, nowise certainly promoted by the unusually meagre, flimsy libretto.

A principal point of attraction is always found in the Symphony, and on this occasion it was not a Mozart, a Beethoven, or a Mendelssohn, but an original manuscript composition of a member of the Orchestra, Ferd. Hermann, that was performed. Herr Hermann directed his own Symphony. It did not meet with a very warm reception, though sufficiently so to afford good encouragement to the author and his friends. There is always so much caution and incredulity, and sometimes suspicion, envy and jealousy abroad, that the path to&nbsp;fame, even to true merit, is rough and beset with difficulties.
Our author, we suppose, could not complain of the manner in which his work was received, and probably a young composer does not often obtain greater approbation. There were undoubtedly fine points in the Symphony, indicating talent, taste and judgment. Its themes were concise and clear, and there seemed to be a considerable degree of the effusion of genuine feeling, without dry detail, commonplace thoughts, or tedious repetitions. The instrumentation was quite well balanced, though the Oboe was, perhaps, somewhat too prominent in the melodic passages; a greater variety of coloring in this respect might be an improvement. The thoughts were easy, natural and chaste, but yet never so striking as to call forth a rapturous or involuntary exclamation of delight or applause. The interest too was well sustained through the four movements, and although we suppose that the critics will not allow to this Symphony a higher place than mediocrity, yet the young author may be well contented with the award bestowed, return to his study, and try again.
Signor Stigelli, a Tenor, from the Royal Italian Opera, London, sang with approbation; Carl Deichmann, a Violinist, from Hanover, played with entire success, a Concerto, by Vieux Temps; an aria by Julius Rietz, (Conductor,) was charmingly sung by Miss Mayer, coming seemingly fresh from the heart, on the tones of a sweet voice.

At the precise hour the organ prelude commenced; it continued two minutes, and the first Lied immediately followed. There was no introit, or introductory motette as in the Nicolai and Thomas churches. The choir consisted of three boys and two men; and beside these, the organist, another person walking about in the organ loft, and myself, there was but one person present — a goodly old lady; so that when the service commenced, the congregation in fact consisted of but one woman. It reminded me of the clergyman who, when he had no one present but the clerk, took the liberty to alter the prescribed form of the service, reading not “Dearly beloved brethren” but “Dearly beloved Roger.” Here was an occasion then, when the singing was indeed congregational. The members of the choir were all singing, the old lady appeared to sing, and I joined the general chorus. The organ was full and made up for any deficiency of vocal power. I observed that in some stanzas the voices commenced without the organ, and sung three or four syllables, when they were joined by the full organ; though in some other stanzas the voices and organ were simultaneous in their commencement. This, however, can have nothing to do with that which we sometimes call expression or the adaptation of the tune to the different stanzas of the hymn, for no attention whatever is paid to this subject here; there is no variation of soft and loud, but every stanza is loud, and is apparently sung and played without the slightest reference to the principle above mentioned. Indeed the principle of adaptation (as generally understood by us in the United States), seems not to belong to the Congregational style of singing. The minister, who was not present at the commencement of the service, came in during the singing of the last stanza, faced the cross upon the altar for a few moments, and then turning towards the people (by this time numbering perhaps between twenty or thirty), he commenced the responsive chanting service. His first sentence is confined to about half a dozen words, which are given in the tones three and five of the scale; this being responded to by the choir, the minister chants quite a long sentence, after which the choir respond Amen. The response closed upon five of the scale, ascending to it by the sharp four — thus five, three, sharp four, five. After this the minister read about two minutes — the people rising. This was followed by the organ, and another hymn. The minister retired the moment he had finished reading (prayer) and was not present during the singing that followed; but at the close of the hymn, as before, he came in and read a scriptural lesson; again he retired, and again the organ announced another choral. By this time some fifty or sixty persons had assembled, and they succeeded in raising quite a chorus. At the close of the last stanza the minister appeared, not at the altar, but in the pulpit, and after half a dozen words of prayer, commenced his sermon. And now the choir, three boys and two men, took their turn in going out; as the minister seemed to have nothing to do with their part of the service, so, I suppose, they were alike relieved when he began to preach. Considering myself by profession and long habit as more nearly allied to choristers than preachers, and especially as I could not understand what was said, and as I could retire without being noticed, and without disturbing others, 1 followed their example.",http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/day/1852-03-24,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/4faa5f817dd0024c6bc311cc330d86be,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/84873c342a6d46ac3fadb9bf3406ee05/1448311764297,Public Indoor Accompanied,http://musicbrainz.org/artist/f422b99a-b48c-4bee-bc0c-f2e8cad82b6c#_,Dr. Lowell Mason Lowell Mason,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Male_vocals http://data.open.ac.uk/led/thing/congregation http://dbpedia.org/resource/Female_vocals http://dbpedia.org/resource/Choir http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pipe_organ,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_music

This invitation was the result of a strong conviction on the part of Niebuhr of the propriety of making such a demonstration of respect, both to his countrymen and to the grandees of Rome, and to the diplomatic body ; and having once made up his mind to do this, the fete was carried out with grand effect, the locality having the advantage, ever belonging to Roman palaces, of suitable space. A fete of the ordinary kind, either with dancing, or a performance of theatrical music, was felt to be too incongruous with the character and taste of the great historian, to be admissible; moreover, it was wholly unsuited to the serious aspect of a house and family, over which the ill-health of Madame Niebuhr cast a continual shadow. In the difficulty of selection of a means of giving object and character to the invitation of a mixed multitude, Bunsen's original suggestion was gladly accepted by Niebuhr, who obtained the assent of Consalvi in the name of the Pope, while Bunsen negotiated on his part with Baini, the selection of singers and of pieces ; in which last the judgement of Kocher was also consulted : and the Missa Papae Marcelli (an early and comparatively cheerful and popular work of Palestrina), the anthem ' Tu es Petrus' (belonging to the Papal Corona tion service, also by Palestrina), and the grand Dies irae (of Pittoni, somewhat later than Palestrina), were chosen as being most effective. Niebuhr himself was neither musical, nor in general fond of music, but he was as susceptible of grand devotional strains, as he was of the echoes of the weal and woe of human races to be found in national melodies: and so far, like Bunsen, he admired what his philosophical reflection approved.",182u-uu-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rome,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/http://data.open.ac.uk/led/music/Missa+Papae+Marcelli/1433771752801/1433771752813,Indoor Accompanied,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Heinrich_Friedrich_Karl_vom_und_zum_Stein http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Prime+Minister+of+Prussia/1433771572593 http://dbpedia.org/resource/Barthold_Georg_Niebuhr http://dbpedia.org/resource/Christian_Charles_Josias_von_Bunsen http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Prince+Hardenberg/1386076559167,"Baron Stein Prime Minister of Prussia Barthold Georg Niebuhr Christian Charles Josias, Baron von Bunsen Baron von Bunsen Christian Karl Josias von Bunsen Christian Charles Josias von Bunsen Prince Hardenberg",Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Religious_music http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vocal_music http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chorale

The impatience with which the return of the de&nbsp;Reszkes was awaited can be better imagined than described. It was emphasized by the fact that they were to be accompanied by their friend and confrere Jean Lassalle, and that the ""French Trio,"" as they were subsequently rather inaptly designated, would make their rentrees together in a &nbsp;gorgeous revival of ""L'Africaine."" That was a &nbsp;great night. The house was literally crammed from floor to ceiling, and the Prince and Princess &nbsp;of Wales led the applause that greeted the now &nbsp;famous Polish tenor on making his debut upon the &nbsp;stage of Covent Garden in the role of Vasco di &nbsp;Gama. He sang magnificently, while Lassalle's &nbsp;Nelusko was, if possible, more fervid, more picturesque than ever. Nordica was less well suited as &nbsp;Selika than as Marguerite in “Faust”, which part &nbsp;she sang with the three distinguished artists later &nbsp;in the season.

Here you see the cascade of the Staubach, which comes down at one fall from a perpendicular rock 800 feet high,— nearly twice the height of St. Paul's. This cascade would be the grandest in the world, if the body of water were greater; but it is composed of so small a rivulet, that it is dispersed into thin spray before it reaches the ground. Instead, therefore, of the tremendous thunder of a raging cataract, the Staubach ""droppeth like the gentle rain from heaven,"" and presents a picture of enchanting softness and beauty […]
&nbsp;While we sat at the foot of the rock within reach of this refreshing shower-bath, admiring the rainbows produced by the morning sun in the falling spray, we were surprised by the sound of music, which seemed to be a duet of two hautboys; and the echoes of the surrounding rocks produced the most pleasing effect. But here again the evil genius of reality appeared to dispel the illusion;—for the enchantment was at once dissolved, on discovering the cause of this music in the persons of two dirty old women.
&nbsp;Their singing was from the throat, and the sounds resembled closely the tones of a flute. It is in the same manner that the famous Kureiholen, or Ranz des Vaches, the national air of the Swiss, is sung; which does not consist of articulated sounds, nor is it accompained by words; but is a simple melody formed by the same kind of guttural intonations.

That same summer I saw a great deal of Herr Raimond von Zur Mühlen. I don’t believe a finer Lieder singer ever lived. People’s opinion used to differ about his voice, but real musicians were unanimous about his splendid interpretation of German music. Rubinstein once put off a performance of one of his works because Von Zur Mühlen was not able to sing in it. To hear him interpret Schumann and Brahms was a perfect revelation. To my intense delight he took up a great number of my German songs, and I can only say that I adored the way he sang them. He sang with splendid rhythm, with such pathos, such deep feeling, and often with such real ecstasy, that it was quite impossible for any musician not to feel enthusiastic over him.

Gilmore’s plans again showed his genius. They were bold, well conceived, but very costly. He went to Europe, and “talked the crowned heads ” (that was the popular phrase) “ into letting their crack ” military bands come over to play in the Jubilee. He obtained the band of the Grenadier Guards from London, about forty- five strong, under Dan Godfrey; a German infantry band, about thirty-five men, under Saro ; and that of the Garde Republicaine, from Paris, of about fifty-five men. It was said that this latter was reinforced by fine artists from the opera, and was not therefore a fair sample of French bands. There was also a little insignificant band, the Royal Constabulary, from Ireland.
These bands had an English day and German, French, and Irish days. The English band was good, the German, too brassy, the French, magnificent . The latter opened with Meyerbeer’s “Torch-Light Dance” ... and won instant success. They had a double quartette of saxophones, four fagotti, a double fagott, and some very large tubas: and the total result was so round, full, and soft, that all musicians were captivated with the deep diapason volume of sound. Their performance of the William Tell overture was superb.",180u-Ll-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boston,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/db9502369f37d208a718d787a74a2ab2/1450281570864,Accompanied Public,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Thomas+Ryan/1448997315048,Thomas Ryan,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Military_band,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Military_march

The delight which the King experienced, he knew not how to give vent to more royally than by expressing a desire to see the tragedy completely performed, the success of which, on the Berlin stage, with the splendid compositions of Mendelssohn, was considerable, and yet not such as to silence the opposition of a critical and gainsaying public, which, instead of beholding in the performance the gratification of artistic taste on the part of the King, was resolved to believe in a design to regulate or school the general taste by authority. At a later period, the 'Oedipus at Colonos ' (the Choruses by Taubert) was performed with good effect, and by the desire of the King, under Bunsen's direction, the great works of Aeschylus (the 'Agamemnon,' the 'Eu menides,' the 'Choephorae') were compressed by Professor Franz into one piece, called the ' Oresteia.' It was hoped that Mendelssohn would have undertaken the arrangement and musical composition of the Choruses, but after much consideration, for reasons indicated in the second volume of his published correspondence, he was obliged to leave the royal wish unfulfilled.'",,,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/http://data.open.ac.uk/led/music/Oedipus+at+Colonus/1434012613145/1434012613158,Indoor Accompanied,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/King+of+Prussia/1375807441992 http://dbpedia.org/resource/Christian_Charles_Josias_von_Bunsen,"King of Prussia Christian Charles Josias, Baron von Bunsen Baron von Bunsen Christian Karl Josias von Bunsen Christian Charles Josias von Bunsen",Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Incidental_music

It was during the same winter that Clara Butt&nbsp;made her first appearance in public. The need for a new concert contralto of the first rank had &nbsp;become pressing. Trebelli had died suddenly at&nbsp;Etretat the previous summer; and in the February &nbsp;of 1894 an even more sudden attack of heart disease&nbsp;closed the career of Janet Patey as she was leaving the platform at a concert at Sheffield. It&nbsp;was curious that midway between these two sad &nbsp;events there should have appeared upon the &nbsp;scene the artist who, whatever her vocal attributes &nbsp;as compared with those of her gifted predecessors, indisputably holds at the present time the position&nbsp;of leading English contralto. &nbsp;&nbsp;
Miss Clara Butt made her debut, while yet a&nbsp;scholar of the Royal College of Music, in a performance of Gluck's “Orpheus"", given by the &nbsp;pupils of the college at the Lyceum Theatre in&nbsp;December, 1892. Her unusually lofty stature&nbsp;lent to the embodiment of Orpheus a dignity and&nbsp;impressiveness that were at least equaled by the&nbsp;organ-like sonority and volume of her ample&nbsp;tones. Then she could neither act nor sing;&nbsp;but there was intelligence in her work, there&nbsp;was an evident faculty for imitation, and, above &nbsp;all, there was glorious material in her powerful, &nbsp;luscious voice.",1892-12-uu,"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lyceum_Theatre,_London",http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/78ca4540f1c28f9a16756a127617949e/1438527005258,Public Accompanied Indoor,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Hermann+Klein/1438157240872,Hermann Klein,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

It is to be remembered that the Civil War had just begun, and calls were made through the newspapers for a national song; it was said that we could no more dispense with it than we could with a flag. A group of patriots in New York City had offered a prize for such a hymn. Dr. Holmes thought we ought to try for the prize. I was eager to do my share. To collaborate with such a man was an honor and a personal delight
Our modus operandi was first to select a strongly marked march-rhythm, then he was to write a few verses to fit it, and when that was satisfactorily done I was to write an original melody to his words. The plan was good and practical. For the rhythm I selected Washington's March. Then Dr. Holmes began work.
He was a “ chain-lightning ” poet in his rapid invention of verses. Furnished with pencil and paper, he sat at the table and I sang with a good lusty voice the melody of the march; singing it alternately slow or quick, soft or loud. After a few trials, he “ caught on ” to the rhythm and quickly found the corresponding poetical measure. From that moment he went on making verses; and the rapidity with which he changed words, ideas, and poetic figures, transposed lines, dropped certain trains of ideas and brought out stronger ones, was extraordinary to me. The verses grew under his fingers as rapidly as one might write an ordinary epistle,—the Doctor singing or humming the melody, or beating the rhythm on the table.&nbsp; We spent perhaps an hour in these researches or exercises till the Doctor had covered perhaps two pages of foolscap with his rough drafts. He then left me, taking them with him, and in a few days he brought me a pencilled copy (which I have kept) of the first verse and chorus that he had finally “whipped into shape,” and which, he said, satisfied his judgment Later on, he brought the entire hymn written with ink (which I now have), five verses in all, entitled Union and Liberty. Under that caption, the hymn was printed later, and afterward included in a collection of his poems.",185u-uu-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boston,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/c7a9d109a8867f02a129e22dc34b1db0/1450274615303,Accompanied Indoor Domestic,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Thomas+Ryan/1448997315048,Thomas Ryan,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Male_vocals,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Song

I seldom attended the festivals of the Three Choirs. They rarely yielded music of an “epoch- making” character, and they always occurred at the beginning of September, just when I was enjoying my hard-earned holiday. I was warned, however, not to miss the Worcester Festival of 1896; and I am glad I did not. That was the meeting which lifted Edward Elgar out of his obscurity as a Malvern teacher and revealed him to his countrymen as a musician of high attainments and still higher promise. For once the “local man"" turned out to be something better than your ordinary writer of “Kapellmeistermusik”; for once the dip in the local lottery-bag yielded a genuine prize.
Edward Elgar produced at this festival a short oratorio entitled “The Light of Life”, founded upon the miracle of the healing of the blind man, related in the ninth chapter of St. John. Its originality, the sense of proportion and tone-color displayed in the choral and orchestral effects, the bold and masterful treatment of the leading themes, and the generally engrossing character of the music fairly took connoisseurs by surprise, and prepared them for the development which so rapidly placed Edward Elgar in the very forefront of contemporary British composers.",http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/day/1896-09-10,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Worcester_Cathedral,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/760f0386a0f25c3fd17d63b21f58892b/1438594133048,Accompanied Public Indoor,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Hermann+Klein/1438157240872,Hermann Klein,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oratorio

The real boundary- line between&nbsp;these two achievements is not so easily settled as most&nbsp;people believe; but this I have ascertained beyond&nbsp;dispute — that in order to reproduce Beethoven, one&nbsp;must be able to produce with him. It would be impossible to make this comprehensible to those who, as long&nbsp;as they have lived, have heard nothing but ordinary&nbsp;performances, and professional renderings of Beethoven's&nbsp;pianoforte works. In the course of time I have gained&nbsp;so melancholy an insight into the evolution and essence&nbsp;of such renderings that I had rather not wound anybody's feellngs by expressing myself more clearly with regard to them. On the other hand I would ask all&nbsp;musicians who have, for instance, heard Beethoven's Op. 106 or 111 played by Liszt to friends in private,&nbsp;what they previously knew about those compositions, and&nbsp;what they learned of them upon those occasions? If this&nbsp;was reproduction, assuredly it was worth much more&nbsp;than all the sonatas reproducing Beethoven which are 'produced' by our pianoforte composers in imitation of&nbsp;those imperfectly comprehended works. The peculiarity&nbsp;of Liszt's development as a musician was simply this —&nbsp;that he did at the piano what others do with pen and&nbsp;ink; and it is undeniable that even the most original&nbsp;composer, during his first period, does nothing but reproduce.""&nbsp;",186u-uu-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rome,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/0f428bb7cfc664ab1942941cb6f3969b/1452592156297,Indoor Accompanied Domestic,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Richard_Wagner,Wagner Wagner Richard Wagner Richard Wagner,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Piano,

It had been previously advertised that at this hour there would be preaching by a divinity student. I attended; the service had already commenced, although there were only three persons in the house. These three were the organist, the singer, and one other person who was in the organ-loft (where I ventured to go), and who seemed to be also a looker-on. The organ was playing with some sixteen or eighteen stops out, and the singer was singing a chorale by himself (in unison!) without a single person to hear or to be edified by the psalm. I was the fourth person. Soon, however, two or three others came in, and as the last stanza was drawing to a close, the minister entered the pulpit from a vestry door. By the time he began his sermon, which was as soon as the singing closed, the congregation numbered in all, including the organist, the singer, the minister and the sexton (who made his appearance when the minister came in), I believe, just twelve persons, six of whom were seated in the body of the house near the pulpit, and appeared to have come for the purpose of attending the service. A short prayer was read before the preaching. The sermon occupied about forty minutes, during which time several persons came in and others went away, so that from the beginning to the end of the exercises, from eighteen to twenty people may have been for a part of the time present. The preacher did not seem to be in the least disconcerted from the fact that he was almost without hearers, but went on as though the house had been quite full. The sexton seemed to enjoy it much, as he had nothing to do, and the singer and the organist, too, seemed to have no particular anxiety as to the effect of the psalmody. The moment the sermon was ended, the minister, preceded by the sexton, retired, and then, after they were out, came the concluding song, which was a grand chorale, performed vocally by the singer (in unison!) and instrumentally by the organist, on sixteen or eighteen stops of his organ. I suppose, too, that the six or seven persons below joined in the song, but they did not add so much to the power of the chorus as to enable me to say with certainty whether the singing was by the congregation, or by the choir only.This account of the second service will appear so strange, that I fear some of your readers may doubt whether the writer is in earnest.

A tablet is seen in one of the rooms, with the amount received for several years in succession from Oratorios given. But alas! for the music&nbsp;now; it is anything but church music. There are nearly 400 children, about half of each sex; they all sit in the organ loft, and all sing the chants, responses, tunes, and services. They are dressed in a neat uniform, the boys in blue, with a white collar turned down, and the girls with white caps and aprons. The organ loft is so arranged, that by the raised seats every one can be distinctly seen.
The service commenced by an organ voluntary; and a lighter, more frivolous piece of organ-playing, I never heard. It was an attempt at a kind of extemporaneous overture with fancy stops, flute, oboe, &amp;c., and great organ contrasts, staccato passages, sudden pianos, and fortes, and sforzandos, in little scraps of melody, light as the lightest of Donizetti or Verdi, without dignity, solemnity, character, or sense. Not a particle of reverence about it. I have heard the organ abused before, and degraded enough, but this was the climax of organ absurdity and degradation.
In the chanting the children kept together, and there was the entire absence of that drawling in the cadences, so common in America. The notes in the cadences were very quickly sung — very much quicker than I have been accustomed to teach them, yet not too quick. But little attention was given to words — they were not properly delivered; but the smaller words were omitted, and many were so clipped or abridged as to be decidedly coarse or vulgar, as
""Glory be t' 'he Father,"" &amp;c. ""As 't was 'n th' beginning,"" &amp;c.
This was particularly observable in the monotone recitation of the Lord’s Prayer and Creed.
The Te Deum was sung in anthem form, and was well done — i.e. they all kept together, pronouncing the words with the speed of an auctioneer, but without any attention to sense, emphasis, pause, and the like.
A strange psalm tune was sung. It was like an andante allegretto, with marked time, by Haydn. Strange indeed, to hear a hymn so sung to music so very light and inappropriate. But it was well done, that is, they all went through it together, as true as a factory wheel goes round, and with as much expression and good taste.
In the place of an anthem, an extract from the Messiah was sung. Rec. “For behold darkness,” &amp;c.; aria, “ The people that walked,” and the chorus “For unto us.” The bass song was well done, by a fine voice, and in quite an artistic manner. The singer did himself much credit indeed, but the chorus was a failure — the little things (children) kept along and got through with it, but no character was given to it whatever. It is not children’s music. Children might as well be required to read Shakspeare, as to sing Handel. They may hit the tones, but they cannot sing the music.
The organ accompaniment was here excellent — orchestra style was required, and orchestra style was played. The staccato was boldly, cleanly, and most distinctly given. Indeed the organ was made a most excellent substitute for an orchestra; and very great skill indeed was manifested by the organist.

Such morning concerts are quite common in the larger German cities. An individual, having the means to do it, employs at his own expense an orchestra, or more probably a quartet, or quintet, makes out his own programme, and invites his friends to spend a couple of hours in listening to fine music. On the present occasion, an audience of perhaps two hundred persons (the most musical people of Frankfort) were brought together. Schindler, the biographer of Beethoven, Schmidt the pianist, and other distinguished persons, were present. The concert consisted of both vocal and instrumental music; and Music’s sister, Elocution, was also brought in, and lent her aid in the exercises of the occasion. The programme contained the following pieces (though not in the order in which they are here put down), viz.:— &nbsp;Quintet (G. minor), Mozart, charmingly — I suppose it may be, said, perfectly played by Messrs. Wolff, Baldenecker, Posch, Drinnenberg, and Siedentopf. Quintet Movement, Mozart. This very beautiful movement by Mozart has not before been played since the year 1783. It has been recently discovered in Mozart’s own hand-writing, among his manuscripts, which for some twenty years have been in the family of André of Offenbach. It will shortly be published. Recitative and Air, with violoncello and obligato accompaniment, composed by John Sebastian Bach. This song is quite of a popular character, notwithstanding it is by Bach, reminding one somewhat of Handel’s most popular songs. It is a sacred song, from an unpublished cantate; but the Recitative and Song will soon be published. Part-Songs, for soprano, alto, tenor, and bass. Two songs were sung by a well-trained double quartet. A Poem on Mozart was well read by a lady, having a rich alto voice, Fraulein Gräemann. The effect of introducing this elocutionary exercise was very pleasing, and the example is a good one to be followed wherever a really excellent reader can be found to sustain the part. Strangers are sometimes invited to play in these concerts; and on the present occasion two pianoforte pieces, “Amitie pour amitie,” composed by the performer, and Doneyschock’s Rhapsodie in C.

One warm July night in 1896 I was present at a large musical party given by the late Mrs. Edward Goetz at her house in Hyde Park Terrace. Always enjoyable were the entertainments of this liberal and sympathetic patroness of the art, who was a daughter of Mr. J. M. Levy, the founder of the “Daily Telegraph”, and sister of Sir Edward Lawson, the genial proprietor of that journal. This, however, was a noteworthy occasion, since it brought to a first hearing a composition which was destined to win popularity in every land where English song flourishes — I refer to Liza Lehmann's graceful and fascinating setting of lines from Omar Khayyam's “Rubaiyat"" (“In a Persian Garden""). I shall not readily forget the mingled surprise and admiration awakened by the novel fragrance and charm of this music, remarkable at once for its sincerity of feeling and expression and the subtle beauty of its harmonic structure. The solos were finely rendered by Albani, Hilda Wilson, Ben Davies, and David Bispham; and the accompaniments were played by the composer, who, I may add, seemed to be not less astonished than delighted at the warmth of the compliments showered upon her.",1896-uu-uu,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/1842cf9a7f59bd785f6b777e18185c46,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/53cb78faa96cec4e8903b4928c4ab0f9/1438596335798,Domestic Indoor Accompanied,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Hermann+Klein/1438157240872,Hermann Klein,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice http://dbpedia.org/resource/Piano,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Song_cycle

Mel [Fräulein Marie Stieffel] was a first-rate musician, and played the piano beautifully. The first time I remember really appreciating music was on one winter afternoon. I was alone in the sitting-room, trying to do my lessons, perched up on my favourite window-seat. In reality I was listening to the trio my governess was playing in the next room with a violinist and ’cello player, friends of hers, who used sometimes to come over from Mannheim to make music with her. I don’t know what they were playing,—it was probably something classical,—but it began to affect me very strangely. I felt horribly sad, but I wasn’t crying. I was simply longing for something, but I didn’t know what. After a while they left off playing, and Mel came into the sitting-room to see what I was doing. Evidently I didn’t look quite normal, for she asked me what was the matter. I said in a choking voice, “ I think I have a sore throat.” I hadn’t a sore throat, but it was the first time I had ever had a lump in my throat, and I didn’t know what it meant then.

Owing to the fact (I suppose) that there were several distinguished solo singers here, the first part of the concert consisted more of vocal music than usual. A chorus of men’s voices was also introduced, and large extracts were given from Cherubini’s opera of “Ali Baba,"" and from Rossini’s “Wilhelm Tell,"" also an aria from Don Juan by Mozart. Two overtures were admirably played, viz.: Leonore No. 2, Beethoven, and William Tell, Rossini. The fine chorus of men’s voices added much to the interest of the concert, but the principal piece was the charming A minor Symphony No. 3, by Mendelssohn. I have often heard this magnificent production of Mendelssohn performed at home, but it is no discredit to our orchestras to say that it is quite a different thing when given with the precision of the Gewandhaus orchestra. I will attempt no description; suffice it to say that it was the perfection of orchestral music — so soft and so loud, so melancholy and so joyful, so exciting and so soothing, so expressive and so effective — imagine it, ye who have no opportunity of hearing it.",1852-01-Ll,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gewandhaus,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/b704feacdca782467e324ddefe37f5de/1448277913293,Accompanied Public Indoor,http://musicbrainz.org/artist/f422b99a-b48c-4bee-bc0c-f2e8cad82b6c#_,Dr. Lowell Mason Lowell Mason,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Choir http://dbpedia.org/resource/Male_vocals http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

In the evening, we went to a party at Torlonia's, the banker;—or as he now is—the Duke of Bracciano. A suite of rooms was thrown open, in which a mob of people wandered about, without object, or amusement. Such a scene could afford little insight into Italian manners, even if the mob were composed exclusively of Italians—but at present, two-thirds, at least, of the company at every party, are English.

He was engaged by Sir Henry Irving to sing “Sigh no more Ladies,” when he produced Much Ado about Nothing at the Lyceum (his mother, of course, called it “Much Ado about Nothing at all”), and the way he sang that song was certainly among the most attractive things in the performance.

I heard [Ole Bull] play The Arkansas Traveller once; I shall never forget it. The piece opened with a short introduction,—a quiet, plaintive air,—at the conclusion of which he gently lifted up his right foot, much in the old-grandfather manner of beating time; then he suddenly brought down that foot with tremendous force on the uncarpeted stage and dashed off into the most reckless, mad, and intoxicated jig any dancer ever heard to start the fever of dancing within him.

[....]
&nbsp;The chants used for the Te Deum and Benedictus, though excellent as music, did not, especially the former, exactly suit the meaning and expression of the words ; exempli gratia, in the verse, “Thou did’st open the Kingdom of Heaven to all believers,” and again, “ Thou sittest at the right hand of God: in the glory of the Father,”—surely such words as these should not be sung to a minor, but to a bright major strain.
The Venite and Psalms for the day (139, 140, and 141) were sung to chants by Frost, Turle, and Barnby—of which Turle’s was by far the best, whilst Barnby's is pretty and rather secular. The singing of the Psalms was admirable throughout—time, tune, clear enunciation, and considerable expression being alike to be admired and commended. The sweet, clear voices of the boys, led by Masters Holliday, Umpleby, Dodds, and Heath, and the sonorous tones of the basses here came out with telling effect, especially in the unison verses, of which I should like to have heard more. Again, the congregation joined with the choir, adding another proof that in such churches as the Hook Memorial, people go now to church to worship for themselves, and not to listen to a substitute like the old defunct parish clerk. When the Psalm says “ Come, let us sing,” the congregations of these days believe in the Psalm, and will not read, nor will they permit any substitute to read or sing for them. It is, therefore, most important, as Mr. Hird knows, that the chants should all be carefully selected, choosing those which have plain, simple melodies and pure, strong chords, which form the chain of church harmony, and, above all, avoiding such as have high reciting notes, or commencing on the major third above C the third space in the treble, and florid phrases. There is one point, however, in chanting the Psalms, which I venture to think the congregation would do well to observe, and that is to sing antiphonally with the choir, instead of joining with both sides, decani and cantoris. To accomplish this properly it might be desirable that most of the congregation should possess Psalters with the sides the choir take marked therein.
The musical voice of the congregation was heard at its best in singing the hymns. There they asserted their right and their power, and occasionally with so much vigour that the organist had to bring out the full power of his instrument to support the united voices of the choir and people. With rare exceptions all the hymns are selected from the popular “ Ancient and Modern ” collection, wherein there is much that is good, and certainly a sprinkling of that which is not good. But why take the tunes quite so fast ? There is a via media in most things, and such a chorale as St Ann's loses much of its dignity and grandeur when sung at the speed it was—especially if wedded to majestic words like—“The Son of God goes forth to war.” One of the hymns (No. 436, “ Gloria ”), good as it is for harmony, will, oddly enough, be found by any musical person to contain melodic phrases exactly like those in the old English song, “ The Vicar of Bray.”
There was both a Processional and a Recessional Hymn, the effect of these with such a large choir, well supported by the congregation and organ, being remarkably fine and impressive. Many conscientious persons object to these Processional and Recessional Hymns, but it must be remembered that it was an ancient custom of the Church, and not only so, but is in itself an act of praise and worship that gives tone, reverence, and solemnity to the beginning and ending of the services. The original use of the cathedral nave was that of preaching to the people, and walking up and down therein singing proces¬sional hymns. Soon after the Reformation the union of walking and singing fell into disuse, and as the people did not hear or did not relish what they heard, the pulpit was removed into the choir, and the nave became a sheepfold, without shepherd and without sheep. Thanks to the awakened spirit of the times, and to the example set by churches like our Parish Church and All Souls’, the nave of cathedrals has been restored to its original use. The Versicles, Preces, Litany, etc., are sung to what is called “ Hill’s Service ”—a modification of the ancient Durham Use, introduced into our Parish Church service when Mr. James Hill was choir-master, during the first part of Dr. Hook’s reign ; but they have been discontinued for some time, and those by the immortal Tallis, of Queen Elizabeth’s time, used instead. The former are comparatively weak, mostly in minor cadences, and are generally dragged by the choir, who sink in pitch considerably, especially in the Litany, which, by the way, was admirably intoned by the vicar, the Rev. Cecil Hook, the other parts being sung by the preacher, the Rev. B. R. Wilson.
The organ voluntaries and accompaniments were throughout admirably played by Mr. Hird, whose good taste and technique were always apparent and acceptable. The March which he played at the conclusion of the service, and which he contributed some years ago to The Organist's Quarterly Journal, served at once to display his ability both as a composer and an executant.",187u-Mm-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leeds,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/6c467b59bc264c09266acedf239858af/1469631300099,Public Accompanied Indoor,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Dr+William+Spark/1465384918944,Dr William Spark,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Choir,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chorale

On the night of Saturday, the 26th April, Signor Mario appeared as the Almaviva of the ""Barbiere”; but only to disappear in the very first scene. An apology was made for ""huskiness,"" and he again came on, omitting his ""aria."" Discontent began to be manifest. The ""Rosina"" (Madame Grisi) came forward, but commenced her air in such ""admired disorder,"" that further manifestations of disapprobation arose. The prima donna, in her turn, came to a stand-still, and confronted the audience with wrathful brow. The jollity of Lablache for a time restored something like composure: at the commencement of the celebrated finale, however, Almaviva having reappeared, and murmurs having been again heard, the indignant tenor left the stage, to return no more that evening. The inimitable humour of Lablache, expressed at this sudden flight, restored the audience to good temper by its irresistible comicality. Another apology was made — Signor Corelli had been sent for; and after some delay, the opera proceeded, with Corelli as the Almaviva of the night. An angry correspondence ensued between the management and the offending tenor: I, on my part, protesting that with but a slight display of good will, Signor Mario might have spared such an indignity to the subscribers and the public — the recalcitrant tenor imperatively asserting that on his part with failing voice, and the burden of public disapprobation, he was wholly dans ses droits in leaving the stage abruptly. The breach between the management and two artists, with whom it was difficult to negotiate, and whom it was next to impossible to control, was thus widened more and more; until, with other elements of discontent (not apparently prominent until the ensuing season) the chasm became so wide and deep, so impossible to bridge over by concession, that a rupture was positively looked forward to as a relief.",http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/day/1845-04-26,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Her_Majesty's_Theatre,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/090b9934148e8bbeb0bcb0c8bd346592/1438680953457,Indoor Public Accompanied,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Benjamin+Lumley/1438607277398,Benjamin Lumley,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

Siegfried Wagner came twice to London. In the autumn of 1894 he challenged criticism as a conductor only, and was “let off” pretty lightly. He &nbsp;wielded the baton with his left hand, but his beat &nbsp;was firm and distinct, and his readings, if colorless, were intelligent and clear. In the summer of&nbsp;1895 he appeared as a composer, and presented to &nbsp;the world, for the first time, a symphonic poem written after Schiller's “Sehnsucht. ""This work revealed promise, but it was “the promise of the &nbsp;child who tries to run before he can walk, the prematurely exposed talent of the artist who represents on canvas some great problem of human life &nbsp;before he has mastered the art of mixing his colors."" At the same concert he gave a practical &nbsp;demonstration of his father's ideas concerning the&nbsp;interpretation of Beethoven's “little” symphony in &nbsp;F. On the other hand, his reading of the “Der Freischutz” overture was “simply remarkable for &nbsp;wilful eccentricity and a flagrant disregard for the &nbsp;obvious intentions of the composer.""",1895-uu-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/London,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/beb9fdfd2a78d615f3c099b852b7cb3b/1438534944921,Public Accompanied Indoor,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Hermann+Klein/1438157240872,Hermann Klein,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Symphonic_poem

There are no carvings, paintings, crosses, statues, or anything ornamental; not even a leather cushion can be found, or the smallest piece of drapery about the pulpit or elsewhere. There is neither organ, choir nor any instrument of music. The seats in the centre of the main floor are of plain, hard boards, unpainted; this part of the house is occupied exclusively by women. The men are mostly in the gallery, which is divided into separate stalls, each for one person. Each stall has a seat swung on hinges, that turns back after the fashion of the old New England swinging seats of a hundred years ago. The men on going into the church did not sit down, but each one took his stand in one of the stalls, waiting for the commencement of the service. Some took off their hats, others continued to wear them. When the bell ceased, the minister stepped up to the railing near the pulpit, and gave out the pitch by sounding the four principal tones of the scale to the syllable la, (1, 3, 5,8,) and immediately the large assembly began to sing. The singing was slow, very slow; I have never before heard a tune sung so slowly as on this occasion. In singing a tune - ""The Old Hundredth,” for example, —I am persuaded that the Rev. Mr. Havergal’s congregation would get through the tune by the time this Zurich assembly would get through the first line. The hymn-book used here, includes, also, the tunes, printed in four parts, and, although the tenor and the alto were not to be heard, yet many of the men made a bold attack upon the bass, which they made to tremble with uncertainty, if not with fear. The trebles in one line sought to attain the pitch of E; they reached a little higher than
Eb, but yet fell short of their aim, and this caused the sinking of the pitch, so that at the end of two stanzas it was something like a tone below its starting point. It was well that but two stanzas were sung; for a new pitch would have been necessary if the number had been much greater. Here, then, is a specimen of congregational singing without a choir or organ.",1852-06-Ee,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/431df3c07a5e9d8b58accd2700565239,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/0d4315f5bdae68e18855387703984663/1448358985746,Accompanied Public Indoor,http://musicbrainz.org/artist/f422b99a-b48c-4bee-bc0c-f2e8cad82b6c#_,Dr. Lowell Mason Lowell Mason,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Male_vocals http://dbpedia.org/resource/Female_vocals http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice http://data.open.ac.uk/led/thing/congregation,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hymn

This same year, by the way, witnessed the brief “Perosi craze”. How that purely artificial vogue ever came to extend beyond the walls of the Italian churches no one knows. At least it should have stopped short at Paris, which was as far as the youthful abbe himself contrived to get on his road to London. But for a time the “craze"" raged in England with the virulence of an epidemic, and many sane musicians persuaded themselves that the new oratorio composer was a genius of the first magnitude. His “Transfiguration"", his “Raising of Lazarus,"" and his “Resurrection of Christ"" were all performed at the London Musical Festival which Robert Newman started at Queen's Hall in May; while his “Passion of Christ"" was given at the Norwich Festival in the autumn. In each instance, however, there was felt a keen sense of disappointment. At best Perosi's works could appeal only to the ear amid ecclesiastical surroundings, and even there their woeful lack of originality was bound to irritate the critical listener.",1899-uu-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Queen's_Hall,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/805f833b99008c1e9bd29148a9ac9ca2/1438598846277,Public Accompanied Indoor,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Hermann+Klein/1438157240872,Hermann Klein,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oratorio

Mr. Eichberg came to this country in 1847, and was in New York for two years. In 1849 he removed to Boston, and was appointed director of music in the Boston Museum. While in that position he composed and produced several operettas of charming quality, notably the Doctor of Alcantara, though as a composer he was academic.

The inequality [unevenness] of the land [of the villa Borghese Pinciana] is taken advantage of in order to produce the most extraordinary effects, one of which surprises the beholder the more as it is rarely met with; it is a lake suspended, as it were, on the summit of a mountain: the waters are carried there at a great expense, but then they give life to these beautiful gardens. They rush from the top of a rock filling the urns of many sculptured nymphs, and at last, flowing round a temple consecrated to Esculapius, this irregular lake is surrounded by magnificent trees, such as chesnut trees, laurels, weeping-willows, and also with fragrant shrubs, the trembling and dome-shaped foliage of which is reflected in the waters which it darkens.
&nbsp;During those beautiful nights, the calmness and freshness of which are so much prized in Italy, this temple and these cascades are sometimes illuminated in an ingenious and pleasing manner. Elegant boats shoot along the borders of the lake, or linger under the flowery bowers; bands of musicians, distributed here and there, make the scene echo with the sublime notes of&nbsp;Paesiello and of&nbsp;Cimorosa, while select companies wander amid the enchanting arbours, or form themselves into parties for dancing.",17Ll-uu-uuTLl:ll:ll,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/1adb75c122c22877a78f72105b32f7d2,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/569b9807be3d14c6174a0bd8fe955aa3/1517846393091,Outdoor Domestic,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Antoine+Laurent+Castellan/1517842957331,Antoine-Laurent Castellan,Performance,,

Mr. Eichberg came to this country in 1847, and was in New York for two years. In 1849 he removed to Boston, and was appointed director of music in the Boston Museum. While in that position he composed and produced several operettas of charming quality, notably the Doctor of Alcantara, though as a composer he was academic.

It was listened to by 19,000 persons; and never do I remember having heard this glorious oratorio performed with so much power and legitimate effect as on this occasion. The blemishes were so slight that they ought not to be alluded to. The difficulties of the work were overcome with ease by the three or four thousand singers, who had been divided into two grand choirs, and whose individual, as well as united endeavours, produced the most gratifying and satisfying performance. From the beginning of the expressive chorus, “ And the children of Israel sighed,” to the song of Miriam, “ I will sing unto the Lord,” with its continued iteration of Divine glory and judgment, there was an enchanting succession of musical triumphs, never to be obliterated from the heart's tablet of a grateful listener. “ He spake the word ” came out from the army of basses in a unisonous tone of sustained thunder; indeed, the choral power was so overwhelming as to swamp entirely sometimes the rapid demi-semiquaver accom-paniments of the violins, etc. The effect of the “ Hailstone Chorus ” was really overwhelming; and here, again, the giant¬like roll of the basses, and the crashes of chords on the words, “fire,” “hail,” etc., electrified the audience, who insisted upon its repetition. Then that wonderful instance of word-painting, u He sent a thick darkness,” with its sustained chords by the strings and its chromatic progressions for the voices, could only be equalled for its fine execution by the supreme excellence of “ He smote all the firstborn of Egypt ” and “ He led them forth like sheep,” the softly-sustained G’s and D’s in the latter, so delicate and pastoral, being worthy of refined solo singing. But I refrain from saying more, lest my enthusiasm for this noble work by Handel—for it is his as it stands, whatever hypercritics may say of the source of some of his themes—should lead me to weary the reader with any long-drawn out disquisition or critical analysis. The whole work left a deep impression upon my mind, and 1 recall it only to regret that one cannot oftener participate in the musical glory of such a magnificent performance. “ God save the Queen ” having been given with overwhelming effect, loud and well-deserved cheers arose for Sir Michael Costa, who returned to the orchestra to acknowledge the compliment, which had been so heartily and spontaneously accorded to him. Mr. Willing was an efficient organist, and M. Sainton, as chef-ctattaque, rendered good service throughout the Festival; and, with the tender of my best thanks for the kind attention of Mr. Gardiner and the stewards of the Sacred Harmonic Society, I take my leave of the recent Handel Festival, and the pleasant week’s enjoyment it brought in its train, with grateful remembrance, and a hope that we may be spared to participate in many more similar gatherings, and with the same gratifying result.",1877-uu-uu,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/bc180dbc583491c00f8a1cd134f7517b,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/5c2b3e5484cdff97ee281ca6a34ae980/1470140218778,Public Outdoor Accompanied,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Dr+William+Spark/1465384918944,Dr William Spark,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Choir http://dbpedia.org/resource/Male_vocals http://dbpedia.org/resource/Female_vocals http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oratorio

It was at this same party at Kensington Palace that I first had the pleasure of hearing Herr Georg Henschel. I was told that he had only just come over to England, and that some German Royalty had given him an introduction to Princess Louise, who, as everyone knows, is devoted to Art in every shape and form, and is herself not only a painter but a sculptress into the bargain. I think it was Herr Henschel’s first appearance at a big private party in London, and he was so young that I can well believe it.

I had not been up a fortnight when the president of the Cambridge University Musical Society called upon me. He believed I played the violin. ""How did he know that ? ""I asked. He laughed out, ""Everybody in the place knows it."" Then and there he requested me to join the Musical Society, and play a solo at the next concert. I readily agreed, and from that time I became solo violinist at the Cambridge Musical Society, and played a solo at nearly every concert in the Town Hall for the next three years. I confess to some nervousness on my first public appearance at a University Concert. It was a grand night. STERNDALE BENNETT, our new professor of music, himself conducted his ""May Queen” and I think MR. COLERIDGE, an enthusiastic amateur and old musical star at the University, since very well known in London, sang. I had selected as my cheval de bataille, RODE'S air in G with variations, and to my own surprise, when my turn came to go on, I was quite shaky. The hall was crammed, the Master of Trinity sat in the front row with other heads of colleges and their families. I tuned in the ante-room. Someone offered me a glass of wine. I had never resorted to stimulants before playing, but I rashly drank it; it was in my head at once; STERNDALE BENNETT conducted me to the platform. I was a total stranger to the company a freshman in my second month only. My fingers felt limp and unrestrained, my head was half swimming. The crowd looked like a mist. I played with exaggerated expression. I tore the passion to tatters. I trampled on the time. I felt the excess of sentiment was bad, and specially abhorrent to STERNDALE BENNETT, who followed my vagaries like a lamb, bless him for ever! But the thing took. The style was new; at least it was unconventional and probably daring, for I really hardly knew what I was about. The Air was listened to in dead silence, half out of curiosity no doubt; but a burst of applause followed the last die-away notes. I plunged into the variations; I felt my execution slovenly and beneath my usual mark; but I was more than once interrupted by applause, and at the close of the next cantabile movement of extreme beauty, which I played better a sort of meditation on the original air the enthusiasm rose to fever pitch; men stood up in the distant gallery and waved their caps, and I remained holding my violin, unable to proceed with the last rapid variation. When silence was restored I played this atrociously; I hardly played it at all, it was quite wild. STERNDALE BENNETT, seeing that it was all up with me that night, hurried and banged it through anyhow; but the critical faculty of the room was gone, so was my head; I had won by a toss, and although then, and often afterwards, owing to neglect of practice, I was frequently not up to my own mark, my position as solo violinist at the University Concerts was never disputed up to the time that I took my degree.",1859-uu-uu,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/0eea6ec6eed6d8667c0493f0c5098f99,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/8679569f631e40a7e1c001e67516f9dc/1437732285749,Accompanied Indoor Public,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/William+Whewell/1437731002725,William Whewell,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,

Who can sleep the first night of their arrival at Tivoli? My delightful bed-chamber was close to the temple of the Sybil, or rather of Vesta, and in sight of a magnificent cascade. The stream dashes itself down, disappears, and separates into a thousand little currents in the subterraneous passages which pierce the mountain upon which this part of the city is built.
The fall of the waters produces a deafening sound, sometimes imitating the noise of thunder, according as the sound strikes directly on the ear, or is dispersed by the wind. Between me and the cascade lay the bridge, the church, and the town; and the effect of the moonlight on the river which flowed round the town was most beautiful.
&nbsp;How different was the scene when I beheld it in the morning, yet equally delightful! The heavens were cloudless, and the dashing of the cascade seemed softened, and it was mingled with sounds which told of the awakening of nature and of man. The chirping of swallows, the turning of mills, the noise [of] the horses' hoofs as they passed the bridge, the voices of the peasants, cloathed in their best habits and hastening to church, the sound of the bells floating on the air, all announced a day of festival. It was indeed so to me to find myself at Tivoli! Nothing is pleasanter here than the perpetual chiming of the bells, so disagreeable in other places: it resembles in Italy a sort of aërial music. So well do this people, whose taste is so delicate in all the arts, know how to harmonize and time their sounds, and to produce intonations as correct as those with which nature has inspired their songs.",17Ll-uu-uuTEe:ee:ee,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/210acd1a55886ae01d5c49526b21dae1,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/fe72e29224ec5f9509e57b04c027a775/1517844542195,Solitary Indoor Domestic,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Antoine+Laurent+Castellan/1517842957331,Antoine-Laurent Castellan,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_bell,

I refer to Jenny Lind. The close association which existed between that gifted and noble woman and the city of Norwich is a matter of common knowledge. A bishop of Norwich (Dr. Stanley) it was who persuaded the first of the “Swedish Nightingales"" to abandon, on religious grounds, the operatic stage; which premature and much-regretted event occurred in 1849. But the famous singer frequently visited Norwich, and more than once she appeared at concerts given on behalf of the funds of the Jenny Lind Infirmary for Children, an institution founded by her and still flourishing in the old city. At one of these concerts, some time during the middle “sixties,"" I heard Jenny Lind sing. The voice, I remember perfectly, was as exquisitely clear and fresh as a young girl's; its sweet tones haunted me long afterward. Of the wondrous art of the great singer I was too young to judge ; but I shall, never forget what she sang, or the rare wealth of religious sentiment with which she invested the prayer of Agathe in the favorite scena from “Der Freischutz”. Upon the stage, of course, the heroine of Weber's opera always kneels while uttering her touching appeal for her lover's safe return, and Jenny Lind also knelt while singing the same passage upon the platform of St. Andrew's Hall on the occasion I am alluding to.",186u-uu-uu,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/58c65f56c545eca5e41927c442c4d105,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/42bdf1e928f0b19c9a6fadd238a07655/1438159498119,Indoor Public Accompanied,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Hermann+Klein/1438157240872,Hermann Klein,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/musicgenre/Opera+aria

[....]
&nbsp;The chants used for the Te Deum and Benedictus, though excellent as music, did not, especially the former, exactly suit the meaning and expression of the words ; exempli gratia, in the verse, “Thou did’st open the Kingdom of Heaven to all believers,” and again, “ Thou sittest at the right hand of God: in the glory of the Father,”—surely such words as these should not be sung to a minor, but to a bright major strain.
The Venite and Psalms for the day (139, 140, and 141) were sung to chants by Frost, Turle, and Barnby—of which Turle’s was by far the best, whilst Barnby's is pretty and rather secular. The singing of the Psalms was admirable throughout—time, tune, clear enunciation, and considerable expression being alike to be admired and commended. The sweet, clear voices of the boys, led by Masters Holliday, Umpleby, Dodds, and Heath, and the sonorous tones of the basses here came out with telling effect, especially in the unison verses, of which I should like to have heard more. Again, the congregation joined with the choir, adding another proof that in such churches as the Hook Memorial, people go now to church to worship for themselves, and not to listen to a substitute like the old defunct parish clerk. When the Psalm says “ Come, let us sing,” the congregations of these days believe in the Psalm, and will not read, nor will they permit any substitute to read or sing for them. It is, therefore, most important, as Mr. Hird knows, that the chants should all be carefully selected, choosing those which have plain, simple melodies and pure, strong chords, which form the chain of church harmony, and, above all, avoiding such as have high reciting notes, or commencing on the major third above C the third space in the treble, and florid phrases. There is one point, however, in chanting the Psalms, which I venture to think the congregation would do well to observe, and that is to sing antiphonally with the choir, instead of joining with both sides, decani and cantoris. To accomplish this properly it might be desirable that most of the congregation should possess Psalters with the sides the choir take marked therein.
The musical voice of the congregation was heard at its best in singing the hymns. There they asserted their right and their power, and occasionally with so much vigour that the organist had to bring out the full power of his instrument to support the united voices of the choir and people. With rare exceptions all the hymns are selected from the popular “ Ancient and Modern ” collection, wherein there is much that is good, and certainly a sprinkling of that which is not good. But why take the tunes quite so fast ? There is a via media in most things, and such a chorale as St Ann's loses much of its dignity and grandeur when sung at the speed it was—especially if wedded to majestic words like—“The Son of God goes forth to war.” One of the hymns (No. 436, “ Gloria ”), good as it is for harmony, will, oddly enough, be found by any musical person to contain melodic phrases exactly like those in the old English song, “ The Vicar of Bray.”
There was both a Processional and a Recessional Hymn, the effect of these with such a large choir, well supported by the congregation and organ, being remarkably fine and impressive. Many conscientious persons object to these Processional and Recessional Hymns, but it must be remembered that it was an ancient custom of the Church, and not only so, but is in itself an act of praise and worship that gives tone, reverence, and solemnity to the beginning and ending of the services. The original use of the cathedral nave was that of preaching to the people, and walking up and down therein singing proces¬sional hymns. Soon after the Reformation the union of walking and singing fell into disuse, and as the people did not hear or did not relish what they heard, the pulpit was removed into the choir, and the nave became a sheepfold, without shepherd and without sheep. Thanks to the awakened spirit of the times, and to the example set by churches like our Parish Church and All Souls’, the nave of cathedrals has been restored to its original use. The Versicles, Preces, Litany, etc., are sung to what is called “ Hill’s Service ”—a modification of the ancient Durham Use, introduced into our Parish Church service when Mr. James Hill was choir-master, during the first part of Dr. Hook’s reign ; but they have been discontinued for some time, and those by the immortal Tallis, of Queen Elizabeth’s time, used instead. The former are comparatively weak, mostly in minor cadences, and are generally dragged by the choir, who sink in pitch considerably, especially in the Litany, which, by the way, was admirably intoned by the vicar, the Rev. Cecil Hook, the other parts being sung by the preacher, the Rev. B. R. Wilson.
The organ voluntaries and accompaniments were throughout admirably played by Mr. Hird, whose good taste and technique were always apparent and acceptable. The March which he played at the conclusion of the service, and which he contributed some years ago to The Organist's Quarterly Journal, served at once to display his ability both as a composer and an executant.",187u-Mm-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leeds,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/70c5273b2e8611f1bea07381aaa693f5/1469630986592,Public Accompanied Indoor,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Dr+William+Spark/1465384918944,Dr William Spark,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Choir http://dbpedia.org/resource/Male_vocals http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pump_organ http://dbpedia.org/resource/Female_vocals,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chorale

The Carl Rosa Opera Company was performing in London about that time. Sir Charles Santley was a member of it, and it was while he was in that company that I heard him sing for the first time in the Trovatore, Fra Diavolo, and many other operas. His singing and exquisite phrasing were a revelation to me. I have heard him criticised as an actor, but at that time, as a singer, he was absolutely perfect. He possessed to a superlative degree all the qualities which make a singer stand head and shoulders above his contemporaries. The “timbre” of his warm baritone voice was quite beautiful, “simpatico” to the last degree, his technique superb (he had studied with Lamperti of Milan, the greatest professor of singing who ever lived, I suppose), and he had not only a great temperament, but he was a finished musician into the bargain, reading the most difficult music easily at sight, and able to express any and every shade of feeling. Whether the music were passionate or tender, graceful or virile, emotional or serene, sad or gay, he sang it with equal insight.",http://data.open.ac.uk/time/interval/1871-Ll-uu/to/1872-Mm-uu,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/bc180dbc583491c00f8a1cd134f7517b,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/e62b69a82c369a2ba8b79c55af320c99/1450873249436,Accompanied Indoor Public,http://musicbrainz.org/artist/eca4d562-1e5c-409a-89fa-5489d102cdcb#_,Maude V.

on the 9th of May the opera of ""Zampa"" was reproduced, for the benefit of Fornasari, that singer taking the part for which he had been originally intended, with a ""cast"" strengthened by Lablache in the comic part of Dandolo. A few special words must be given to this occasion. Already Fornasari had ceased to hold the supreme position which had been hastily and generally granted him during the previous season, and though he was still enthusiastically received by the general public, a few ""carpings and cavillings"" began to be heard. Doubts timorously indeed were whispered here and there, and it became gradually evident that Fornasari was not exactly the ""conquering hero"" which previous trumpetings had so loudly proclaimed him. In spite of his efforts on this occasion, backed by the advantage of Lablache's name and the singing of Persiani, in spite of the catching melodies, the vigorous chorusses and the dramatic style of Herold, ""Zampa"" failed in establishing itself upon the Anglo-Italian boards. After a very few nights, on which it was lustily applauded, it wholly disappeared from the bills. However, in behalf of the fame of Herold, it should be mentioned that a considerable portion of the frequenters of Her Majesty's Theatre only admitted at this period, as acceptable on its boards, the Italian school, pur et simple, and looked with coldness and mistrust on any names, how's ever accredited, which revealed a French, a German, or, still worse, an English origin. Thus Herold can in fact scarcely be said to have had ""fair play"" at Her Majesty's Theatre.",http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/day/1844-05-09,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Her_Majesty's_Theatre,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/d5e30ddf3ff802089e6dc7b89b768ad5/1438616205359,Public Indoor Accompanied,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Benjamin+Lumley/1438607277398,Benjamin Lumley,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

The stalls, boxes, and pit were crowded with&nbsp;the elite of Viennese society, fashionable, artistic, and&nbsp;literary...fill[ing] all the ""numbered''&nbsp;seats at the Wieden...&nbsp;whilst the galleries were thronged almost to suffocation by Strauss's most enthusiastic admirers — the true&nbsp;bom Viennese of the lower middle classes. Archduke&nbsp;William — who, being Grand Master of the Order of St.&nbsp;John, seldom shows himself in a theatre — occupied the&nbsp;Imperial Box, whilst King Milan of Servia sate out the&nbsp;whole performance in a ground-tier stage box, signifying&nbsp;his admiration for the bénéficiaire's talents and achievements by conferring upon him, towards the close of the&nbsp;evening, the Cross of the Takovo Order. The progranmie of the occasion consisted of selections from&nbsp;Strauss's operas, conducted by himself. His desk was&nbsp;converted for the nonce into a gorgeous flower-bed of the&nbsp;costliest exotics; and his appearance thereat, baton in&nbsp;hand, was the signal for a demonstration of affectionate&nbsp;rejoicing on the part of the audience, such as, according&nbsp;to the leading journals of the Kaiserstadt, has never&nbsp;before been witnessed within the walls of a Vienna&nbsp;theatre. He opened the entertainment with his bright&nbsp;little overture to Indigo — his first opera, produced at the&nbsp;Wieden Theatre about twenty years ago — which was&nbsp;rapturously re-demanded. Then came the first act of A&nbsp;Night in Venice, followed by the immortal Schoene blaue&nbsp;Donau during the entr'acte, which inimitable waltz&nbsp;brought down a shower of laurel wreaths upon its composer's head. The second act of Fledermaus with some&nbsp;additions to the dialogue written especially for the&nbsp;occasion, came next, and was succeeded by ""musical&nbsp;episodes "" from Spitzentuch, Methusalem, Cagliostro, Der Lustige Krieg and the Carnival in Rome,&nbsp;each successive&nbsp;number being supplemented by presentations of addresses,&nbsp;medals, and flowers.&nbsp;",http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/day/1884-10-15,,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/47b7c8d930c651543a58a3e0b5dac054/1451947136357,Indoor Public Accompanied,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/William+Beatty-Kingston/1444079044346 http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Milian+I+of+Serbia/1451947039739,William Beatty-Kingston Milian I of Serbia,Performance,,

But never, to my dying day, shall I forget the gipsies I heard that same night in Pesth. They came and played in the hall of the hotel where we had arranged to stay for two or three days. The landlord said to me, “Ah, you are in luck ! There is no such other ‘Zigeuner’ band in the whole country. When Liszt was here he kept them playing half through the night.” And so did I! I half-ruined myself over them. Never have I spent money so recklessly - felt I really could not bear to let them go. More than ever did I feel as though I had suddenly been brought face to face with my Doppelgänger, as if some impassioned lover of happiness and freedom, who had once been myself, had threaded her way through the wild mazes of that mad, fantastic music to look into my eyes, to claim recognition, to remind me of those splendid, vanished days ! Ah! she needn’t have been afraid of my denying her ! Every drop of blood in my veins claimed her as my own - my very own ! I longed to lay my hand in hers, to shake the dust of cities off my feet, and wander carelessly again through the beautiful world of golden days and starry nights, and drink deep draughts of ecstasy, and quench my thirst for ever and ever !",188u-Ee-uu,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/8c1eb22fe09731865b4cd2d46d60bbf1,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/76d643458accce0aee6fb985ce276cdb/1476601165269,Public Indoor Accompanied,http://musicbrainz.org/artist/eca4d562-1e5c-409a-89fa-5489d102cdcb#_,Maude V.

This unique masterwork of Franz Schubert [Schubert D-minor Quartette ] has always been the one oftenest asked for, and I must mention one other solemn occasion when we had to play it A young lady died in Dorchester who had been one of our earnest friends and music lovers. She left a sum of money with her brother in order that he might engage the Quintette Club to play certain selections at her funeral. She had planned the entire function. We played in a room adjoining the parlor where the religious service was held. We began with the Swan Song, playing it with muted strings. That was followed by prayer. Then we played one of the Seven Last Words of Christ,—music composed for string quartette. Next the burial service was read, followed by addresses from friends; and we ended the exercises by playing another of the Seven Last Words.
This was certainly an occasion when firmness and composure were needed. Imagine having to play music of such technical difficulty at such a time, in such a situation, where the burden of the song, “Death and theMaiden,” had its counterpart in the adjoining chamber, for there was death, and there also was the maiden.
I knew that the girl during the brief span of her life had a very elevated and spiritual love for music; it spoke to her as nothing else did. And her brother, told me she was steadfast in the belief that she would be present in spirit during these last earthly rites, and would again hear the music she loved so well.
Knowing these facts, I was greatly affected while playing. They kept surging through my thoughts and brought me to the very verge of sobbing.

My friend, Signor Puzzi, Mademoiselle Grisi, and Lablache, on their way to the festival at Manchester, gave a concert at Leicester, in which the wonderful powers of these artists were shown, especially in two pieces from the opera 'I Puritani', by Bellini. It has been the fashion to decry this author, and to speak of him as a literary thief, stealing from Rossini. The two pieces just mentioned are sufficiently distinct in style to admit of no such imputation. The ideas are original, and very beautiful. The metallic lustre of Grisi's voice was finely shown in the long holding note upon A, in ' A te, o Cara,' to which is added an unrivalled execution. Lablache's magnificent voice I have dilated upon in the ' Music of Nature,' but in the piece just mentioned I was charmed by his vocal pizzicato, if I may so speak ; the short expressive manner of his touching the isolated quavers, an effect new and delightful.",1836-09-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leicester,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/http://data.open.ac.uk/led/music/I+Puritani/1435610393991/1435610394008,Accompanied Indoor Public,http://bnb.data.bl.uk/id/person/GardinerWilliam1770-1853,William  Gardiner William Gardiner,Performance,,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

It was at this same party at Kensington Palace that I first had the pleasure of hearing Herr Georg Henschel. I was told that he had only just come over to England, and that some German Royalty had given him an introduction to Princess Louise, who, as everyone knows, is devoted to Art in every shape and form, and is herself not only a painter but a sculptress into the bargain. I think it was Herr Henschel’s first appearance at a big private party in London, and he was so young that I can well believe it. We were all young then, for this party took place a very long time ago - nevertheless, I remember how beautifully he sang, and how beautifully he accompanied himself in several interesting songs of his own composition.",187u-Ll-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kensington_Palace,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/cd30711f417b3e38680c8bd71fd9911c/1452078978791,Accompanied Indoor,http://musicbrainz.org/artist/eca4d562-1e5c-409a-89fa-5489d102cdcb#_,Maude V.

The last vibration of the AVE MARIA BELL was tingling, the last sun-light was fading from the bending tower of the Assinello; the shadows of the arched porticos deepened, and the miracles and processions painted in fresco on the walls of convents and monasteries (for a moment visible) sunk rapidly in the sudden gloom which terminates Italian twilight. The joyous sounds of the vintage had died away, and were succeeded by the solemn silence, the cloistral sobriety, of the learned Bologna of the middle ages—the retreat of studious abstraction and monastic severity. As the evening advanced, and the moon rose, the tingling of guitars was heard, the imagery of Shakspeare's plays (one scarcely knew why) was recalled; and when we returned to our Hotel, the ""Ciechi,"" a delightful band of blind musicians, who play for hire in the streets of Bologna till midnight, were already assembled to hail other travellers, as well as ourselves, at the [Hotel] Pellegrino; and to symphonize a supper which would have done credit to a Parisian restaurateur.",18Ee-uu-uuTLl:ll:ll,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bologna,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/8dd09bb74f2ff14533c49885888afe6e/1516534989524,Outdoor Accompanied Public,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Lady+Sydney+Morgan/1515698191138,Lady Sydney Morgan,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Guitar,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Instrumental

It was an old ballad, which I had heard once before : —
'Say, have you in the village seen A lonely youth, of pensive mien? If such a one hath passed by, With melancholy in his eye, Where is he gone ? Ah, tell me where! Tis Allan Brook, of Windermere.' 
It was sung by Miss Jane. Her pensive look, and the soft accents of her voice, enchanted me. The spell, however, was suddenly broken by the wine- drinkers bursting into the room. They had listened to the song, and begged to hear it again. The Captain, however, with good taste, called upon his daughter to sing him his favourite : —
 ""In the world's crooked path where I've been, There to share of life's gloom my poor part, The bright sunshine that softened the scene Was a smile from the girl of my heart."" 
This was loudly applauded.I had crept into a corner during this interval, when my fair one asked me to sing. I was aware that nothing tender or sentimental would please at this moment, and I hit upon the convivial strain which Purcel sang to Charles the Second [...] The merriment was silenced by a flash of lightning, and the large drops of rain drove the ladies from the verandah.",17Ll-uu-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Earl_Shilton,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/f94eaed3932eb55ba2ba1ab6b91f6b60/1444726486902,Indoor Accompanied Domestic,http://bnb.data.bl.uk/id/person/GardinerWilliam1770-1853,William  Gardiner William Gardiner,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Song http://dbpedia.org/resource/Popular_music

The subject of the fugue was, perhaps, a little too chromatic for the dignity of worship, but it was played slowly and with great precision and certainty.
At the close of the voluntary, the minister, followed by the session, entered; the former took his place in the pulpit; the latter took their places in seats appropriated to them, on each side, facing the congregation. The organ then gave out the tune Iosco — the melody was made very prominent, the bass was played by the pedals, and an intermediate figured accompaniment filled up the harmony, producing a fine effect. The hymn, the subject of which was prayer to Jesus for his spirit, was finely sung by the whole assembly, all singing the melody. At the end of the first line of the last stanza, which was doxological, the minister rose in the pulpit, not to find his place in the Bible as if he was in a hurry to cut off the last act of praise, but apparently as an act of reverence, as he kept standing, without any movement, and was soon followed in his example by all the male part of his congregation. A short prayer followed the hymn; then an address (extempore) of four or five minutes; after this the regular morning prayer was read; another hymn was sung as before, and the sermon followed. There were two hymns sung afterwards, making four times singing during the exercises. Here was a very simple, appropriate, devotional service for a Sabbath morning, — almost the same, indeed, as is the religious service in our Presbyterian, Baptist, or Congregational churches, and vastly superior to the Lutheran or English Cathedral repetitions and forms.",1852-06-Mm,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/06e3de3de77d9ffc37f51e63e679237b,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/0d4315f5bdae68e18855387703984663/1448360119742,Accompanied Indoor Public,http://musicbrainz.org/artist/f422b99a-b48c-4bee-bc0c-f2e8cad82b6c#_,Dr. Lowell Mason Lowell Mason,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pipe_organ http://data.open.ac.uk/led/thing/congregation,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hymn

That has happened to music in Italy, which happens to language and style, to poetry and painting, and indeed to every thing else in this world. When a certain point of perfection has been attained, the progress afterwards is in a contrary direction; and a corruption of taste is introduced by the very attempt to pursue improvement beyond that line, which limits all human exertion by the irreversible fiat;—"" thus far shalt thou go, and no farther."" But though music must be considered as on the decline in Italy, there is, notwithstanding, a general diffusion of musical taste and musical talent, extending to the lowest ranks. I have often set my window open at night to listen to the ""dying falls"" of a favourite air, distributed into parts, and sung by a party of mechanics returning home from their work, with a degree of skill and science that would not have disgraced professional performers. The serenade is a compliment of gallantry, by no means confined to the rich. It is customary for a lover, even of the lowest class, to haunt the dwelling of his mistress chanting a rondo, or roundelay, during the period of his courtship.

The concert room is not large, but convenient, and good for musical effect. The centre of the room is occupied by ladies, and the outer seats mostly by gentlemen. A narrow gallery, in which are a number of private boxes, runs round the room. The first object of attraction, after entering the room, is a fine large medallion of Mendelssohn, back of the orchestra; there is no other bust or picture in the room. It makes one feel sod when looking at this fine representation of the great modem composer, in the very room where he has been, and still is, so highly appreciated, and where he has so often triumphed gloriously, to think that he was cut off in his youth, and that the musical world, after so short a time of enjoyment, was deprived of the talents and learning of one who promised to do for music, perhaps, more than any man living. At almost every concert, more or less of his music is performed; his memory is cherished, not only here, where he was so well known, but by all the musical world, and his name shall be held in everlasting remembrance.
A crowd of people were waiting round the door, when we arrived; and, although it was an hour before the time for the performance to commence, the room was filled, (save the reserved seats in the gallery,) in a few minutes after the door was opened. One must be on hand at an early hour to get a good seat. In about half an hour the members of the orchestra began to make their appearance, and as all the people in the house were talking loud, so the musicians, as they came in, one after another, began to tune, to try their instruments, and to amuse themselves by running over the scales; so that by the time they were all there, thus employed, the room was filled with sound; the more so because, as the musicians began to exercise themselves upon their instruments, the talking and laughing grew louder and louder, and at a quarter of an hour before the commencement of the music, it was a perfect Babel in the concert room, and as difficult to hear one speak as it is in a railroad car, with all the windows open, in summer. But a few minutes before the hour, the room began to grow quiet, musical expectation began to awaken, and when, as the precise moment arrived, the conductor’s signal was heard, everything was still, and perfect silence took the place of noise and confusion. Another signal, and the whole band, as one man, were heard interpreting and presenting to a most attentive audience, one of the great works of the immortal Beethoven.
It was the Sinfonie No. 8, F major. This is not regarded as one of Beethoven’s greatest triumphs; but, although it is light and playful, it abounds in each of its four movements, with the most fanciful and imaginative melodic figures, contrapuntal points, and instrumental contrasts. Ever lively and ever new, it never tires, but holds one in a kind of musical ecstasy from beginning to end; there seems to be no place where one can relax attention, or cease to be filled with musical delight; so that at the close of each part, a good long breath naturally comes in as a relief; and one becomes conscious of the intensity of the application he has been giving to the discourse.
The very first thing which strikes one, on hearing such an orchestra as this, is the perfect oneness of the violins. They do, indeed, constitute a perfect chorus — ten or more persons are playing the first violin, and as many more the second; but they are all artists, and, therefore, each one loses himself; no one is heard above the others; but all so beautifully blend as to constitute one perfect whole. This is the perfection of a chorus, be it vocal or instrumental; and this effect is produced by the Gewandhaus Orchestra.
Another point, immediately noticed, is the proper proportion of wind and stringed instruments; but perhaps the most striking point, as contrasted with our American orchestras, is the perfection of the wind instruments. It is too often the case in our orchestras that some wind instrument is wanting; thus the oboe or the faggotto is often missing; and again, it is not unfrequently the case that, although there may be some one to hold these or other instruments in the hand, or up to the sight of the audience, a tone is seldom permitted to escape from them; they are seen but not heard, Not so here; every instrument is not only represented to the eye, but is in the hands of a master who makes it speak to the ear. The consequence is, that such combinations fall upon the ear as are not heard with us. The brass instruments too are made to tell their story without any impediment of speech; whereas, with us, they stutter, or falter, or hem, or cough, to the no small disturbance of the equilibrium of one’s temper. We do not know that in this concert every instrument is played in all respects right; we do not know but some notes may have been omitted, or wrong tones produced, but certain are we that we did not discover any such imperfections. There are four things, (technical points,) that we have seldom heard well exhibited elsewhere, which were exceedingly well brought out here, viz.: Piano, Crescendo, Diminuendo and Fortzando. These, with the other technicals of playing were so well observed, that added to the pure tone peculiar to each particular instrument, and connected with a most perfect amalgamation or blending of all the different elements of the orchestra, they seemed to produce, not a mere musical performance to be listened to, but a living being, or moral, spiritual existence, capable of expressing the deepest feeling, and of calling forth the strongest sympathies of humanity.
The Sinfonie being over, and a few moments for rest having been given, old Handel visited us in an Arie from his Opera “Aerio” — “Folle e colui che al tuo favor si fida.” It was sung by Herrn Salvatore Marchesi, who was the only vocalist for the evening. The song was well sung; but we sometimes hear quite as good singing across the Atlantic. Belletti is decidedly his superior. The third piece was a Flute Concerto; it was a tiresome affair. A Flute Concerto is a Flute Concerto, whether in the Gewandhaus, Hanover Square rooms, Tripler Hall or the Melodeon; and although it may not be always played by Herrn W. Haake, (who certainly did his duty well,) it is always the most dry and uninteresting of musical performances.
In part 2d was given, 1st, the beautiful overture Echoes of Ossian, (often played in New York and Boston,) by N. W. Gade. 2d. Arie from Zauberflote, by Mozart, “Qui sdegno non s' accende."" 3d. Mendelssohn’s concerto for the piano forte, in D. Minor. 4th. Arie from Don Giovanni, by Mozart, “Madamina, il catalogo e questo,"" and 5th. The very fine overture to the opera, “Der Wassertrager,” by Cherubini.
Gade’s overture may be regarded as a sacred piece. It speaks of greatness, and calls forth emotions of the sublime. Something like an Old Chorale pervades the whole, which seems to tell of worship, and to call forth humble adoration. With what grandeur this subject was given out, and oft in the course of the piece alluded to by the brass instruments, or exemplified and illustrated by the others, cannot be told. The overture is known with us, but it requires and deserves dose study.
The Piano Forte Concerto, D (not G) Minor, failed for want of a performer; a highly promising young lad of the conservatory attempted it, but he had neither grasp of mind nor of hand enough for Mendelssohn. Herr Marchesi sang both airs well, gaining for himself decided applause.
On the whole, here is a highly-talented and well-regulated orchestra. The conductor for the evening was Julius Rietz, well known to the musical world.
I will mention one or two things about the audience:
1st. Gentlemen took off their hats before passing the door of the hall, all of them, without a single exception; and this, although they were there an hour before the performance commenced. There was not a single man standing under the galleries or near the doors, uncovered. The ungentlemanly act of standing or sitting in a concert room with hats on, could not be seen in the Gewandhaus.
2d. Ladies were all in full dress.
3d. There was silence during the performance of music. The moment the music ceased, then indeed there was a perfect buzzing of voices, and very loud talking all over the room; but at the signal for the commencement of the music, all was still; and we were not prevented from hearing the music by those whisperings, so annoying in some places.
On the whole, this was a very fine concert; the orchestra playing was as near to perfection, I doubt not, as can often be found; and that constitutes the great attraction of the Gewandhaus. Every man seems to be able to play on his own instrument well; every man seems to give undivided attention to the music, and to endeavor to observe carefully, not only the time, as given by the conductor, but all those little gesticulations by which expression is indicated.

The conductor was Robert Schumann himself; the pianist was his wife. The orchestra was large, and the best that Leipzig could furnish. Robert Schumann has great celebrity, and especially in those cities where he has resided and has brought out his music under his own immediate direction. No one since Mendelssohn’s death stands so high in the estimation of the German musicians. There are places where he is not known, because his music is not understood; but even in these, and throughout Germany, he is regarded as standing at the very head of his profession, and no one commands aa. he does the universal attention of scientific men. Some go so far as to regard him as the greatest symphonist that has ever lived; but time can only determine this.
The concert had been advertised for some time, and the expectations of the lovers of music were fully awake. Not only were the musicians and lovers of music of Leipzig present, but literary and scientific men of the various professions, and the beauty, and wealth, and fashion of the city came to do homage to talent of so high an order, and to learning so extensive. Like the people at Lystra, so here, they lifted up their voices, saying, not in the speech of Lycaonia, but in that of Saxony ""The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men.”&nbsp;
[...]
But it was not only from this city that the audience was gathered on this occasion; it had been noised abroad that this concert was to be given, and musical men of high standing, Kapellmeisters and Concertmeisters, from the region round about, came up to Leipzig. Berlin, Dresden, Weimar, and other places were represented. At the head of this foreign company, and indeed at the head of the whole company, was Lis[zt];— the very Lis[zt] himself came from Weimar to listen, and to pay honor to greatness. But Robert Schumann is not alone, he has a “help meet” indeed. Clara Wieck was perhaps the most distinguished female pianist who has ever lived; and, unlike many ladies, she did not give up her instrument when she became Clara Schumann, but rather devoted herself with greater assiduousness under her new instructor, than she had previously done under the teachings of her father, to the profession which had been the choice of both her husband and herself. No wonder that the people should assemble on the occasion of a visit from this far-famed couple. But they came not to hear any one sing or play on an instrument, for although the wife is indeed a most accomplished pianist, yet the husband neither plays nor sings; but they rather came to hear the new music that the master had produced. They looked for some new musical revelation, for new chords (if possible), or new progressions; at least some new method of treatment, or harmonic development was expected. It was not to be the same tune over again. They went away satisfied; for, not only was the musical performance pronounced to be one of the very best, but the music, or the principal piece of attraction, was regarded as worthy of its author.
The first piece was the “Overture zu L. Byron's Manfred&nbsp;von R. Schumann,"" This is an overture in the true learned German style, and as unlike the overtures of the modem Italian and French schools as can be imagined; of course, it cannot be popular, that is, it cannot take with the people generally; on this occasion, however, it was fully appreciated and listened to, by one of the most intelligent musical audiences that could be brought together in Germany, with unmingled delight. The second piece was “Concert No. 2, F moll, fur Piano Forte mit Begleitung des or Chester, von F. Chopin,” performed by Clara Schumann. This is said to be in Chopin’s peculiar style, and one of his most difficult productions. Mad. Schumann played it with apparent ease, and with a delicacy of touch and distinctness of articulation not to be excelled. She has not so great a power as some; in this respect she resembles Chopin himself, but in everything else requisite to the perfection of piano forte playing she is fully accomplished. The third piece was a song by Herr Behr, necessary for variety’s sake; after which Mad. Schumann played most charmingly two pieces- “Andantino von W. Sterndale Bennett"" and ""Lied ohne Worte (F major), von F. Mendelssohn Bartholdy.”
The second part of the concert (and here was the attraction) consisted of “Die Pilgerfahrt der Rose” (the pilgrimage of the rose), a new composition for voices (solo and chorus) and orchestra by Robert Schumann. This has been performed here a week or two before, and was noticed in a previous communication. Anything like an analytical notice of it from one who has heard it but once or twice would hardly be expected, and in the present case it would be quite absurd. It will be known in a few years. The orchestra never played better; the idea of playing under Schumann inspired every man with new life and energy, and the improvement in the performance of the music under the direction of the composer (there having been a previous rehearsal also under his teaching), was said to be very apparent. We can hardly imagine a musical occasion that would be more interesting or exciting especially to the truly enlightened musician than this. For the few details here given we are indebted to others, for we did not attend this concert; we neither saw the sight nor heard the sound thereof. Why? It was given on Sunday Morning, March 14th, at 11 o'clock.",http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/day/1852-03-14,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/0a19459865ed69275723d6efb76048c9,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/c1430fd90e2f5c420be71ed139947826/1448285063123,Accompanied Indoor Public,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Franz+Liszt/1424794451085 http://musicbrainz.org/artist/f422b99a-b48c-4bee-bc0c-f2e8cad82b6c#_,Franz Liszt Dr. Lowell Mason Lowell Mason,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra http://dbpedia.org/resource/Piano,

They consist of vocal and instrumental music, but without orchestra. They employ some five or six solo performers, and a choir of about forty-five choristers. Glees and madrigals are sung by the choir, and songs, duets, &amp;c., by the solo voices, with piano forte pieces, violin pieces, or other instruments as it may be convenient to obtain for the different concerts. I attended the second of the series on Thursday last. The large Exeter Hall was full of people, who seemed to be much delighted with the music; indeed I thought that there was more warmth of approval exhibited there than we usually see at the best concerts with us. The solo performers were Miss Pyne, Miss Louisa Pyne, Miss Binckes, Mr. Swift, (a new tenor,) Herr Jonghmans, Mr. Cotton, and Mr. Whitworth. Miss Goddard played serenade (Don Pasquale), by Thalberg, and also an andante and rondo capricioso by Mendelssohn, on the piano forte, and Mr. Richardson played an air with variations on the flute. Miss Binckes has a very fine voice, and sung to the great acceptance of the audience, and Miss Louisa Pyne sung quite a difficult aria by Rode, which called forth a most enthusiastic encore. The pieces for full choir were performed without accompaniment, not even the piano forte being played; and although I have heard a better chorus at home, yet this was truly good. The concert was conducted by Mr. T. H. Severn. The programme contained the music to the National Anthem, printed in full in four parts, and the whole audience joined in this the closing chorus:
&nbsp;
“God save our gracious Queen,
Long may Victoria reign;
God save the Queen!
Send her victorious,
Happy and glorious,
Long to reign over us,
God save the Queen!
&nbsp;
""O Lord our God arise,
Scatter her enemies,
And make them fall.
Confound their politics,
Frustrate their knavish tricks,
On Thee our hopes we fix,
God save us all.
&nbsp;
""Thy choicest gifts in store&nbsp;
On her be pleased to pour,
Long may she reign;
May she defend our laws,
And ever give us cause,
To sing with heart and voice,
God save the Queen!",1852-01-Mm,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/249e970d5f9a49b3819d2da3de7c2e7f,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/685afff7ca62bded16af47975829b67e/1448275383231,Indoor Public Accompanied,,,Performance,,http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_anthem

The final rehearsal for the opening concert of the festival took place at the Albert Hall on May 5. Wagner had himself chosen the programmes. He was to conduct each first part, consisting of selections from all his operas, from “Rienzi” to “Tristan""; while Hans Richter, who now made his first appearance in England, was to direct the excerpts from “Der Ring des Nibelungen"" that formed each second part. Most of the preliminary work had been done under Mr. Dannreuther, in whom Wagner reposed great confidence. All that remained was to give the finishing touches and for the composer-conductor to accustom himself to the vast auditorium and the huge crescent-shaped phalanx of orchestral players spread before him. From the outset, as it seemed to me, he failed to place himself en rapport with either. The abnormal conditions appeared completely to upset him. In a word, he succumbed there and then to a severe attack of Albert Hall stage fright— an illness familiar to nearly every artist on stepping for the first time upon the platform of that gigantic amphitheatre. However, after a glance of astonishment round the empty hall, and a few whispered words to Wilhelmj, and yet a few more to Hans Richter (who was posted beside the conductor's desk), the great man raised his baton and gave the signal for the start. The inaugural piece was the “Kaisermarsch,"" and it was well chosen for the purpose. Its pompous and sonorous strains, proceeding with stately rhythmical movement throughout, were perfectly calculated to show off the imposing volume of the big orchestra in such a building as that. It gave no trouble, and the effect was superb. But, unluckily, instead of imbuing Wagner with a little confidence, this preludial essay left him more palpably nervous than before. 
The second piece on the list was the overture to the “Fliegende Hollander”. Here, I confess, I looked for something exceptional. I had always understood that Wagner was a fine conductor, at least of works with which he was in true sympathy, and I expected his reading of the “Dutchman"" overture to be in the nature of a revelation. Imagine, then, my disappointment and sorrow when it resulted in a complete breakdown! Twice—nay, thrice— did he make a fresh start, while Mr. Dannreuther and Mr. Deichmann (the faithful leader of the second violins) took it by turns to translate his complaints and instructions to the orchestra. But it was of no avail. He utterly failed either to indicate or to obtain what he wanted, and at last, in sheer despair, he threw down his stick and requested Richter to do the work for him. Well do I remember the sharp round of applause with which the band greeted the Viennese conductor as he mounted the rostrum. It was thoughtless—unkind, if you will; for it must have smote with unpleasant sound upon the ears of the sensitive composer. But the overture went without a hitch. It was played as I had never heard it played before.",http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/day/1877-05-05,,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/60f52463ce1a347d5ac2d229e19f95a6/1438189684526,Accompanied Public Indoor,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Hermann+Klein/1438157240872,Hermann Klein,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Overture

Puccini's “Tosca"" was the solitary new opera produced in 1900, and, thanks to the genius of Fraulein Ternina, its many beauties were at once made patent to all who were willing to perceive them. That artist's superb assumption of Floria Tosca, coming as it did on top of a series of triumphs in such roles as Brilnnhilde, Sieglinde, Elsa, Elisabeth, and Leonora, was but another revelation of her versatility and of her vocal and histrionic charm. This was Ternina's first essay as the heroine of Puccini's picturesque work, and she received excellent support from De Lucia as Pietro Cavaradossi, and from Scotti as Scarpia — this last a creation which has won universal recognition as an ideal presentment of one of the most subtle and malevolent figures in modern opera. Altogether it was a splendid performance, and Luigi Mancinelli conducted it in his most masterly manner.",1900-uu-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Covent_Garden,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/bd777621637ec098df2f816b035d5983/1438599385507,Accompanied Public Indoor,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Hermann+Klein/1438157240872,Hermann Klein,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

There is but one place where a good choir is sustained, namely, the “Chapel of All Saints.” This a beautiful building, about one hundred and fifty feet in length, ninety in width, and seventy in height. There are a number of fine carvings ; and the whole interior is finely covered with fresco paintings, on a gold ground; so that the appearance, as one enters the building, is very splendid. We attended at this chapel on two occasions, on each of which high mass was performed, viz., Ascension-day and the Sabbath morning following. The music on the first day was by the director, Aiblinger, well known as a composer of Masses, Motets, &amp;c. The choristers numbered about twenty-four, or six voices on a part, being composed of the best professional vocalists, or opera singers, in Munich. The organ was well played, but never as an accompaniment, as the vocal music was without any accompaniment whatever. There was, in the performance of this choir, all the full, dear, and certain delivery and union of vocal tones that the most fastidious critic could desire; though less of the crescendo and diminuendo than in the Dom choir at Berlin; but in one respect, the Munich choir had a great advantage, — the Soprano and Alto parts were sustained by femail voices. Consequently, there was a fulness, richness, and maturity of voice, and a blending in the chorus; neither of which can be obtained in choirs where boys sing the Soprano. There is a disagreeable effect always resulting from the predominance of boys’ voices in a choir. The attempt to unite them with adult voices, is like the attempt to mix oil with water; they will not coalesce.

Then we had the Rasoumoffski Quartette in F, op. 57, by Beethoven, with Wieniawski playing first violin. Then the Schumann Piano Quintette, with Rubinstein at the piano. Oh, it was a joy to take part with such a man and in such a work! and how Rubinstein did spur us on by his passionate way of playing some of the great parts! his power was fierce and tremendous. I think we all revelled in the sea of sound we made about us.
After the Quintette, Rubinstein played a lot of choice solo pieces, ending the evening with the Chopin Polonaise in A flat, op. 53, in which comes the wonderful passage for the left hand in octaves.

It must have been about the year 1846 that I was taken up to a concert at Exeter Hall, and heard there for the first time what seemed to me to be music or unearthly sweetness. The room was crowded. I was far behind. I could only see the fiddle-sticks of the band in the distance. Four long-drawn-out tender wails on the wind rising, rising; then a soft, rapid, flickering kind of sound, high up in the treble clef, broke from a multitude of fiddles, ever growing in complexity as the two fiddles at each desk divided the harmonies amongst them, pausing as the deep melodious breathing of wind instruments suspended in heavy slumbrous sighs their restless agitation, then recommencing till a climax was reached, and the whole band broke in with that magnificent subject which marks the first complete and satisfying period of musical solution in the overture to the ""Midsummer Night's Dream!"" I was at once affected as I had never before been. I did not know then that it was the MENDELSSOHN mania that had come upon me. It seized upon the whole musical world of forty years ago, and discoloured the taste and judgment of those affected, for every other composer. The epidemic lasted for about twenty years at its height; declined rather suddenly with the growing appreciation of SCHUMANN, the tardy recognition of SPOHR, and the revival of SCHUBERT, receiving its quietus of course with the triumph of WAGNER. People now ""place"" MENDELSSOHN, then they worshipped him. Can I forget the heavenly close of that dream overture that day? MR. WILLY that capital chef d'orchestre, so strict, so true, so sympathetic was leading the band. The enchanting master, who was to pass away in the following year, FELIX MENDELSSOHN, was still alive. He might have been in London at the time.",1846-uu-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Exeter_Hall,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/43426d26b8c61b63db12b142b72b9fec/1437642814674,Indoor Accompanied Public,,,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Overture

Sontag, by marriage the Countess Rossi. The weather was unfavorable, being rainy, and the streets were muddy. I took my place at the door of the Gewandhaus at half-past four, where the people were then gathering. By five, when the outer door was opened, a multitude had assembled, and immediately rushed into the house, filling the long stairway and entry. Here was another interval of waiting, until half-past five, when the door of the hall was opened, and the room was immediately filled. We had now to wait another hour, or until half-past six; when the performance commenced with a Symphonie, by Joseph Hadyn in C, very light, playful, and pleasing, but lacking the depth of a Beethoven or a Mendelssohn. It is so easy a composition, that it seemed to be quite children’s play for the orchestra, who yet rendered it in the most perfect manner possible. This was followed by an Arie from “Rinaldo” by Handel; a most charming song indeed, and as charmingly sung by Mad. Sontag. Of Mad. Sontag’s singing, I dare not speak now. I will only say that no one can have a more perfect execution; but to say in what her excellence consists, as a singer, or what are the peculiarities of her style, must not now be attempted.
The third piece was “Romanze for the Violin,” by Beethoven; performed by Herr Concertmeister, Ferdinand David. This is the David whose compositions for the violin are so well known, and whose reputation as a player is so extensive. Mad. Sontag then sang ""Bel raggio lusinghier,"" from Rossini’s Semiramide, a song requiring the greatest powers of vocalization; this was perfectly given by the inimitable artist.
The second part consisted of the Overture and a long scene from Gluck’s famous “Iphigenie in Tauride;"" the principal vocal part being that of Iphigenie by Mad. Sontag. Gluck has not been heard with us, but he ranks in the very first class of composers here. The overture is a magnificent concert piece, and it was performed by this fine orchestra with wonderful precision and effect. Beethoven’s Overture to Egmont closed the musical entertainments of the evening, and well repaid one for his Two Thalers, (cost of a ticket,) and for all the previous waiting, wetting, and crowding necessary to secure a place to stand up.",1852-02-Mm,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/0a19459865ed69275723d6efb76048c9,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/f6ed35d76f1bc969a02387bf8b7cdc4f/1448278841531,Indoor Public Accompanied,http://musicbrainz.org/artist/f422b99a-b48c-4bee-bc0c-f2e8cad82b6c#_,Dr. Lowell Mason Lowell Mason,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soprano,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aria

One day I said in jest to August Fries,“ You ’ll do nothing till I am a member of the Mendelssohn Quintette Club.” Shortly after, one of the gentlemen, Mr. Greuner, removed to Lowell, and I was invited to take his place. Then Mr. Gierlow resigned, and Francis Riha, the former leader of the Steyermark Orchestra, took his place and thus became the second violin. We played very much together and got into fine trim.
Mr. Bigelow, who was our fatherly friend, and remained such all through life, suggested that we should prepare to give concerts, and make that a part of our life-work. The question of a name naturally came up. Mendelssohn was on the top of the musical wave at that time, and, as we had practised his quintette, Opus 18, till we could venture to play it in public, it was determined to call our party, The Mendelssohn Quintette Club of Boston. We gave our first concert by invitation, in Jonas Chickering’s piano rooms, then on Washington Street, nearly opposite the Adams House.",184u-uu-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boston,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/b2a04c315f4defe9cb365b088eac2de6/1450215311469,Domestic Indoor Accompanied,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Thomas+Ryan/1448997315048,Thomas Ryan,Performance,,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_music

On his return to town in the evening, he attended a reception given in his honor at the Grosvenor Gallery by Walter Bache. This was in some respects the most striking function of the series. The gathering was in every sense a representative one, and the famous abbe, as he went round chatting from group to group, seemed positively radiant with happiness. To repeat his own words, addressed to myself: “You have so overwhelmed me with kindness in this country that I shall be quite sorry when the time comes for me to leave you.” The programme comprised his “Angelus” for strings, a chorus for female voices, a pianoforte piece, and some songs; and finally, amid a scene of great excitement, he himself played the finale of Schubert's “Divertissement a la Hongroise” and his own Hungarian rhapsody in A minor. This glorious treat furnished the crowning feature of a memorable evening— doubly memorable because it was the last time but one that Franz Liszt touched his instrument in the presence of a public or quasi-public assemblage.",http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/day/1886-04-08,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/8846cca4a0345e0b412424b32ec881c4,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/0b9c0574a51ce9d37947efd9ae511af3/1438263410325,Accompanied Indoor Domestic,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Hermann+Klein/1438157240872,Hermann Klein,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/String_instrument,http://dbpedia.org/resource/String_quartet

Surman. There are two societies meeting in Exeter Hall; the Sacred Harmonic Society, under the direction of Mr. Costa, and the one before mentioned. There were about one hundred and fifty members of the choir present at the meeting of the London Sacred Harmonic Society, with an accompaniment of about twenty stringed instruments. A new Anthem, by Dr. Elvey, of Windsor, was sung, and also Mozart’s Twelfth Mass. The performance was decidedly poor — vastly inferior to the German choruses which we have recently described. The time was tolerably well kept, but tune was far enough from accuracy. The same feeling about for the pitch, and uncertainty of tone, was observable in the more difficult modulations, which is so common with our untrained New England choirs; with this difference, however, that we occasionally stop to correct a badly-intoned passage, whereas here it was passed over as if unobserved, or as if such a dissonant performance had become a matter of habit. There was, too, an absence of all those things that go to make up a good choral performance, as Forte and Piano, Sforzando, Syncopated accent, distinctness and clearness of vocal utterance, &amp;c. The leader would occasionally sing out at the top of his voice, “Piano,” but he did not seem to expect that attention would be given to what he said, and kept on, under a press of sail, until another opportunity should occur for calling out with like result.
This was, indeed, a rehearsal; but if a choir is permitted to sing thus in rehearsal, will they not form habits that will prevent improvement, and will not the public performances be of the same general character?
The violins were badly played. One could hardly help coming to the conclusion that they were mostly beginners, assembled for practice. It would not be surprising to hear as bad, or even a worse, rehearsal, on the Western Continent; but, in Europe there should be, at least, a correct performance of the technicals of music, if not something belonging to the higher department of appropriate expression.",1852-08-Ee,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/249e970d5f9a49b3819d2da3de7c2e7f,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/97cce7edc7c3833b5aae1a9d2613043e/1448396105675,Public Accompanied Indoor,http://musicbrainz.org/artist/f422b99a-b48c-4bee-bc0c-f2e8cad82b6c#_,Dr. Lowell Mason Lowell Mason,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Choir http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mass_(music) http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_music

She is a French lady, and a true artist. [...] Of her a very competent critic has said, in one of the papers, “She has never been equaled by any of her predecessors.” While we might be willing to admit the truth of this remark in regard to some particular points of excellence, we do not acknowledge it as a general truth; and it must be credited to the favorable disposition of the newspaper critic. She has a voice rich in tone, extensive in compass, and of great flexibility. Her lower register is very fine, having more power than that of Sontag; indeed this is true of her whole compass, and in this particular she may be compared to Jenny Lind. With respect to quality and purity of tone, we think the latter lady may have the preference in the higher register, but elsewhere the voice of De la Grange is superior. In her lesson in the “Barber,” of Rossini, she ran up with apparent ease to the thrice-marked small g; and in her songs in the Zauberflöte she touched the thrice-marked small f with the ease and accuracy of a pianoforte. She sings with a freedom, openness, frankness of voice (so to speak) that we have scarcely ever heard equaled, and never excelled. She is, perhaps, thirty years of age, and of most interesting personal appearance, good figure, large and bewitching eyes, easy, graceful, and elegant in every movement and gesticulation.

&nbsp;Teresa [Carrefio ]* made her first appearance in Boston, January 4, 1863. She remained here about one month, and was a great attraction at the grand orchestral concerts which were given at that period under the direction of Carl Zerrahn or P. S. Gilmore. She created a furore of enthusiasm every time she played. I doubt if any child pianist of the same age has ever exceeded her in ability. Imagine a child of nine years playing Thalberg’s Moses, Gottschalk’s Jerusalem, and similar pieces, full of technical difficulties.

In those days DE BERIOT'S music reigned supreme in the concert-room until the appearance of PAGANINI. It had not yet gone out of fashion, and I remember hearing OURY play DE BERIOT'S showy first concerto -with a full orchestra, at the Pavilion, in a way which reminded me of some conqueror traversing a battle-field; the enthusiasm he aroused was quite remarkable, in that languid and ignorant crowd of loitering triflers.

I have been to day to hear Sir Gore Ouseley's little boy, and never was I so affected by anything in my life. I can find no words to express my astonished delight when I saw the little fellow, only six years old, sit down to the pianoforte, and commence an extemporaneous performance, which baffles all description. His large dark eyes lighted up, his whole soul seemed intent upon what he was about, and yet with all this there was such a genuine childish simplicity. I could not say half of what I feel.
I am afraid this will be thought an exaggeration, but I never was an admirer of wonderful children. I have seen many who had extraordinary execution upon an instrument, but God has given this child an intuitive knowledge of the most hidden mysteries of sound—a creative power perfectly organized that surpasses belief.
Read the accounts of Mozart's infancy and you have read this child's, I sat down to the piano, and while his mother held him at a distance, I endeavoured to puzzle him by the most intricate modulations, but he not only instantly named the key I was playing in, but followed every change (even when an enharmonic transition rendered it almost inappreciable to the ear) with the rapidity of thought,—he knew it, but he knew not why.
In the course of playing I struck the chord of the sharp 6th—the German 6th as called by some writers, and upon resolving it in the usual way he started up and cried out ""that is the sharp 6th in the key of C minor, and I can dissolve it another way."" He ran to the piano, and without a moment's hesitation struck the chord, and proceeded to resolve it in a most abstruse but perfectly correct manner, and then went on modulating till he brought it back to the original key. He played me numbers of the airs he had written, all distinguished by the exquisite taste and plaintiveness of their character, some marches loud and lively with an evident idea of orchestral effect in their arrangement ; indeed orchestral and dramatic effect pervades every note he plays.
I can never forget the impression this scene made upon me. I am not ashamed to say that it affected me to tears.

During our Wagner chats she would often ask me about Bayreuth, &nbsp;and I begged her to seize the first opportunity of &nbsp;attending the festival. She did not do so, however, until after her marriage with Baron Cederstrom, who is extremely fond of traveling, and, &nbsp;beside taking his wife to Sweden every summer, &nbsp;introduces her to many interesting European resorts. The following letter tells its own tale: &nbsp;&nbsp;
FIhrens Villa, near Saltsjobaden, Stockholm, &nbsp;August 5, 1901. &nbsp;
Dear Mr. Klein : &nbsp;&nbsp;We have just arrived at this lovely place after spending a very pleasant time in Switzerland and at Bayreuth, &nbsp;and I must send you first these few lines to tell you how &nbsp;immensely I was impressed by the Bayreuth performances.

I had three rooms at the furthest extremity of the old court leading into the Bishop's Hostel. Open windows commanding two Quads made me a very formidable and undesirable neighbour. Incessant practising with a saloon pistol with which I was a crack shot on my doors added a general liveliness to the situation. Occasionally I received midnight expostulations. It was agreed at last that firing was not to go on after eight o'clock, nor music after ten. This latter rule was, I admit, more honoured in the breach than the observance, and often have I seen MR. FROST or JOHN LUNN musical fellows of neighbouring colleges pounding away in their shirt-sleeves, cigar in mouth, at my piano till past midnight, while I myself, the present EARL OF MAR, and MR. GEORGE COOKE still a notable violoncello player in London (1883) &amp;c., made up the quartet or quintet in the rear. The consumption of beer and buttered muffins after tea was unusually large on certain hot nights. The listeners who stepped in to smoke and chat, declared that under the infliction of music additional support was absolutely needed. The dean occasionally sent polite and deprecatory messages from over the way, whilst Messrs.

He very kindly appointed me to the semi-chorus, and my place was near the front, on the left-hand side of the orchestra, where I had a fine view of this astonishing sight...
The music was the service of the church as performed in the cathedrals, solemn and grand, heightened in its effects by a band of one hundred and fifty instrumental performers, and nearly three hundred voices. The parts usually sung by a single voice were performed by six of the most eminent English singers to each part. This was a delicious treat ; under no other circumstances could such a rich mixture of voices have been heard. During the performance of Handel's anthem, describing the crowning of King Solomon, the Queen was conducted by her ladies behind the purple and gold tapestry into Henry the Seventh's Chapel, where she was robed for her coronation. She soon returned under a canopy of gold. It then wanted three minutes to two o'clock. A telegraphic communication was made from the floor through the roof, and a rocket announced that the crown was placed on her head. The cannon instantly thundered from the Park and the Tower, and the five hundred instruments and voices poured forth ' The Queen shall rejoice in her strength, for the Lord hath set a crown of pure gold on her head.'",1838-06-28TEe:ee:ee,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Westminster_Abbey,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/http://data.open.ac.uk/led/music/Zadok+the+priest/1435612479336/1435612479348,Indoor Public Accompanied,http://bnb.data.bl.uk/id/person/GardinerWilliam1770-1853 http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Queen+Victoria/1393599242108,William  Gardiner William Gardiner Queen Victoria,Performance,,

By [Wieprecht's] invitation I attended a performance by three of the best infantry bands in Berlin, each numbering about fifty or sixty performers. As at the military concert in Hamburg, they played with thrilling effect a programme of about twenty pieces separately and unitedly. In the music for the combined bands there was not that replication of parts so common in similar performances in England, but it was specially arranged so that each band in turn took its part accompanied by the others. The whole performance concluded with a military piece entitled the “Battle of Leipzig,” in which cannons were fired at intervals with unerring precision at the beginning of the bar. This pleased me less than any other piece, but it seemed to raise the rest of the audience to the highest pitch of enthusiasm.",1870-Mm-uu,,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/a98263581e29cdc63e8115b6188f669f/1465387572287,Accompanied Indoor Domestic,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Dr+William+Spark/1465384918944,Dr William Spark,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brass,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Martial_music

Sontag, by marriage the Countess Rossi. The weather was unfavorable, being rainy, and the streets were muddy. I took my place at the door of the Gewandhaus at half-past four, where the people were then gathering. By five, when the outer door was opened, a multitude had assembled, and immediately rushed into the house, filling the long stairway and entry. Here was another interval of waiting, until half-past five, when the door of the hall was opened, and the room was immediately filled. We had now to wait another hour, or until half-past six; when the performance commenced with a Symphonie, by Joseph Hadyn in C, very light, playful, and pleasing, but lacking the depth of a Beethoven or a Mendelssohn. It is so easy a composition, that it seemed to be quite children’s play for the orchestra, who yet rendered it in the most perfect manner possible. This was followed by an Arie from “Rinaldo” by Handel; a most charming song indeed, and as charmingly sung by Mad. Sontag. Of Mad. Sontag’s singing, I dare not speak now. I will only say that no one can have a more perfect execution; but to say in what her excellence consists, as a singer, or what are the peculiarities of her style, must not now be attempted.
The third piece was “Romanze for the Violin,” by Beethoven; performed by Herr Concertmeister, Ferdinand David. This is the David whose compositions for the violin are so well known, and whose reputation as a player is so extensive. Mad. Sontag then sang ""Bel raggio lusinghier,"" from Rossini’s Semiramide, a song requiring the greatest powers of vocalization; this was perfectly given by the inimitable artist.
The second part consisted of the Overture and a long scene from Gluck’s famous “Iphigenie in Tauride;"" the principal vocal part being that of Iphigenie by Mad. Sontag. Gluck has not been heard with us, but he ranks in the very first class of composers here. The overture is a magnificent concert piece, and it was performed by this fine orchestra with wonderful precision and effect. Beethoven’s Overture to Egmont closed the musical entertainments of the evening, and well repaid one for his Two Thalers, (cost of a ticket,) and for all the previous waiting, wetting, and crowding necessary to secure a place to stand up.",1852-02-Mm,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/0a19459865ed69275723d6efb76048c9,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/9a15990ba6b6b9179f2fb38acc0df350/1448278630995,Indoor Public Accompanied,http://musicbrainz.org/artist/f422b99a-b48c-4bee-bc0c-f2e8cad82b6c#_,Dr. Lowell Mason Lowell Mason,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Female_vocals http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soprano,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aria

The other novelty was Ricci's “Corrado d'Altamura”, which was supported by Grisi, Mario, and Fornasari. This opera had been one of the items of the original programme of the season, but although it had been produced at almost every continental theatre, even out of Italy, it never was calculated to make a favourable impression on the London boards. It made its appearance towards the close of the season, but even had it been brought forward at a more auspicious date, it is questionable whether it could ever have maintained its ground. A heavy opera, based upon a dull libretto, had little chances in its favour with an excitement-seeking London audience, and ""Corrado d'Altamura"" was only performed on one single night.",1844-uu-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Her_Majesty's_Theatre,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/99aa4626a1843a93872c739be9995e6b/1438617078585,Public Accompanied Indoor,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Benjamin+Lumley/1438607277398,Benjamin Lumley,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

A merry party of young people, laughing and shouting, pass by towards the Uffizi we listen to their ringing voices, occupied with themselves, and, youth-like, caring for nothing at the time but their own gaiety, when sud- denly the voices fall, the twanging of the guitar ceases, a curious murmur runs through the merry throng, and not a pleasant murmur; a tall, pale man, with eyes on fire, -and strange, imperious look, has pushed brusquely in amongst them. He seizes the guitar, and, sweeping its strings with passion, causes it to wail like a zither, then peal out like the strains of a military band, and finally settle into the rich chords and settled cadences of a strong harp. All resistance and murmuring ceases as the astonished party follow him, spell-bound. His cravat flies loose, his coat-tails wave madly to and fro, he gesticulates like a maniac, and the irresistible music streams forth louder, wilder, more magical than ever he strides, leaps, dances forward with the guitar, which is no longer a guitar, but the very soul of NICOLO PAGANINI.

The part which music played in the Italian Revolution was remarkable. A certain gay and intrepid march tune, characteristically called ""Garibaldi's Hymn,"" was shouted, blown, scraped, and rattled on drums in and out of season. The whole spirit of the volunteer movement seemed to be in it. When I first heard it at Genoa, it sounded poor and commonplace; but as day by day and all day long it sounded in my ears, it began at last to ring in my head; and by the time I got to Naples I was humming and whistling it with all the world. To see the jaunty, ragged volunteers marching along the hot roads covered with white marble dust, and keeping pace to ""Garibaldi's Hymn,"" is one of my most vivid memories. It was to Italians of 1860 what the ""Marseillaise"" was to the French of 1793 but as much purer and more joyous than that fierce and gloomy stave, as the movement for freedom under GARIBALDI and MAZZINI was brighter and purer than the confused and murderous cries for liberty in 1793 under ROBESPIERRE and DANTON.",1860-uu-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Genoa,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/39c45cd48b81b01509621309260a0619/1437736206545,Public Accompanied Outdoor,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hugh_Reginald_Haweis,Hugh Reginald Haweis,Performance,,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Song

Strauss, violin in hand, conducted the orchestra daily, in one of his most popular waltzes, and also in some little knick-knacks, such as the Pizzicato Polka, which became at once a great favorite. His manner of conducting was very animating. He led off with the violin bow to give the tempo, but when the right swing was obtained and the melody was singing out from the orchestra, he joined in with his fiddle as if he must take part in the intoxication of the waltz. While playing or conducting he commonly kept his body in motion, rising and falling on his toes in a really graceful manner.",180u-uu-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boston,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/2981e96eb514cfee8367000beecad306/1450282080296,Accompanied Indoor Public,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Thomas+Ryan/1448997315048,Thomas Ryan,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Violin,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dance_music

He obtained the band of the Grenadier Guards from London, about forty- five strong, under Dan Godfrey; a German infantry band, about thirty-five men, under Saro ; and that of the Garde Republicaine, from Paris, of about fifty-five men. It was said that this latter was reinforced by fine artists from the opera, and was not therefore a fair sample of French bands. There was also a little insignificant band, the Royal Constabulary, from Ireland.
These bands had an English day and German, French, and Irish days. The English band was good, the German, too brassy, the French, magnificent . The latter opened with Meyerbeer’s “Torch-Light Dance” ... and won instant success. They had a double quartette of saxophones, four fagotti, a double fagott, and some very large tubas: and the total result was so round, full, and soft, that all musicians were captivated with the deep diapason volume of sound.

Such morning concerts are quite common in the larger German cities. An individual, having the means to do it, employs at his own expense an orchestra, or more probably a quartet, or quintet, makes out his own programme, and invites his friends to spend a couple of hours in listening to fine music. On the present occasion, an audience of perhaps two hundred persons (the most musical people of Frankfort) were brought together. Schindler, the biographer of Beethoven, Schmidt the pianist, and other distinguished persons, were present. The concert consisted of both vocal and instrumental music; and Music’s sister, Elocution, was also brought in, and lent her aid in the exercises of the occasion. The programme contained the following pieces (though not in the order in which they are here put down), viz.:— &nbsp;Quintet (G. minor), Mozart, charmingly — I suppose it may be, said, perfectly played by Messrs. Wolff, Baldenecker, Posch, Drinnenberg, and Siedentopf. Quintet Movement, Mozart. This very beautiful movement by Mozart has not before been played since the year 1783. It has been recently discovered in Mozart’s own hand-writing, among his manuscripts, which for some twenty years have been in the family of André of Offenbach. It will shortly be published. Recitative and Air, with violoncello and obligato accompaniment, composed by John Sebastian Bach. This song is quite of a popular character, notwithstanding it is by Bach, reminding one somewhat of Handel’s most popular songs. It is a sacred song, from an unpublished cantate; but the Recitative and Song will soon be published. Part-Songs, for soprano, alto, tenor, and bass. Two songs were sung by a well-trained double quartet. A Poem on Mozart was well read by a lady, having a rich alto voice, Fraulein Gräemann. The effect of introducing this elocutionary exercise was very pleasing, and the example is a good one to be followed wherever a really excellent reader can be found to sustain the part. Strangers are sometimes invited to play in these concerts; and on the present occasion two pianoforte pieces, “Amitie pour amitie,” composed by the performer, and Doneyschock’s Rhapsodie in C.

On one memorable occasion Rubinstein and Wieniawski did me the honor to spend an evening at my house in Boston. A right royal musical evening it was, shared by about fifty artist and amateur guests. We made much music,—beginning with Rubinstein’s String Quintette in F, op. 57. Then we had the Rasoumoffski Quartette in F, op. 57, by Beethoven, with Wieniawski playing first violin. Then the Schumann Piano Quintette, with Rubinstein at the piano. Oh, it was a joy to take part with such a man and in such a work! and how Rubinstein did spur us on by his passionate way of playing some of the great parts! his power was fierce and tremendous. I think we all revelled in the sea of sound we made about us.
After the Quintette, Rubinstein played a lot of choice solo pieces, ending the evening with the Chopin Polonaise in A flat, op. 53, in which comes the wonderful passage for the left hand in octaves. He began the phrase very soft, then the “little-by-little crescendo” was most admirably done, finally reaching a fortissimo power which was quite colossal. It stirred us all up, and set even the chandelier to jingling in sympathy, and possibly in admiration.",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boston,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/a9c61e2e8e0bfa3f42b4cf88c274ffd3/1449477566527,Domestic Indoor Accompanied,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Thomas+Ryan/1448997315048,Thomas Ryan,MusicalExpression,,

He tries to earn money as a travelling bookseller]
[W]ere kept there [Perth] a few days by some old aquaintances, started thence towards Methven, sold little on the way thither, but were kindly treated by the workers at Huntingtower and Cromwell Park. The people there were themselves on limited work—indeed, many of them had none; yet they shared their little substance with those that had less. It is always so; but for the poor, the poorer would perish.
Just before entering Methven, I sold a small book to a person breaking stones for the road. After some conversation, I discovered he was musical, and was strongly tempted to sell him my flute. He had taken a fancy to it, and offered a good price. I resisted; it had long been my companion, and sometimes my solace; and indeed, to speak truth, for some days past, attended to certain “forlorn hope” whisperings, implying the possible necessity of using the instrument in a way more to be lamented than admired. […] The demand for our lodging-money [at Methven] was decided, and so was I. I took my woe-warn partner [wife] aside, whispered her to pick my flute from out our “budgets,” put on her mantle, and follow me. As we went along I disclosed my purpose of playing in the outskirts of the village.
[…]
&nbsp;[W]e found ourselves in a beautiful green lane, fairly out of town, and opposite a genteel-looking house, at the windows of which sat several well-dressed people.
[…]
The sun had been down a good while, and the gloamin’ [sunset afterglow] was lovely. In spite of everything, I felt a momentary reprieve. I dipped my dry flute in a little burn [stream], and began to play. It rang sweetly amongst the trees. I moved on and on, still playing, and still facing the town. “The flowers of the forest” brought me before the house lately mentioned. My music raised one window after another, and in less than ten minutes put me in possession of 3s 9d of good British money. […] I had also a turn for strathspeys [a type of dance tune] and there appeared to be a run on them. By this time I was nearing the middle of the town. When I finally made my way, and retired to my lodging, it was with five shillings and some pence, in addition to what was given us.",183u-Ll-uu,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/44a9cafa64e3718a31f75634f44c7256,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/8fe7e418df9704696ed818e81adfd22a/1524245292841,Indoor Domestic Accompanied,,,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flute,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Folk_music

My last recollection of Heidelberg is a concert given by the celebrated violinist Joachim. I was taken to it as a great treat, and wore a new silk dress for the occasion. I also wore a grand little opera-cloak trimmed with swansdown. To tell the truth, I was so taken up with the unusual splendour of my appearance that I hardly listened to the music. It is an awful confession, but I am obliged to make it.

I do not think, on the whole, the sea-coast street music, especially at Brighton, has improved during the last thirty years the German bands, niggers, and itinerant. I can recollect fine part-singing out of doors in the old days, and I know of no small band violin, tenor, flute, and harp at all comparable to that of SIGNOR BENEVENTANO, who used to play on the beach at Brighton, with a power of expression that drew crowds, and half-crowns too. I was so much fascinated by this Italian, that I took him home with me and bade him try my violin. It was simply horrible. He scraped, and rasped, and powdered the rosin all over the finger-board, till I was glad to get the instrument out of his hands. The fact is, the coarse playing, so effective on the Parade, was intolerable indoors. He was essentially a street player a genius, but his music was, like coarse and effective scene-painting, better a little way off.",185u-uu-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brighton,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/3c407654f0df94fddd4bc766520c6da1/1437730282977,Domestic Indoor Solitary,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hugh_Reginald_Haweis,Hugh Reginald Haweis,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Violin,

And now Thursday, the 4th of May, drew nigh. The privileged of the theatre told tales abroad of the appearance of the ""Swedish Nightingale"" at rehearsal, of her enthusiastic reception by all the members of the orchestra, of her overpowering emotion on facing this tumultuously flattering welcome, and of her undiminished, nay, increased powers. Thursday, the 4th of May came. The scenes of excitement in all the thoroughfares leading to the theatre were once more renewed; again were struggling crowds early at the doors; again were hats doubled up, and dresses torn; and again was the throng of carriages, the clamour and conflict of coachmen, servants, policemen, mob, the same as of yore. A ""Jenny Lind crush"" had lost nothing of its fever and intensity. The adored prima donna was to make her reappearance in the part which, more than all, had fascinated her enraptured admirers of the previous year, namely, the part of Amina in ""La Sonnambula."" Words fail to describe the aspect of the overcrowded house, the tumultuous reception, the enthusiasm which knew no bounds and no limits of time, or to give an idea of the prolonged cheering that followed every vocal display on the part of this idol of the public. The house was crowded to a state of impossibility, which eagerness and determination had exercised their magic to make possible. The Court was present ; and an incident, independent of the great event of the evening, is worthy of record. It was the first appearance of the Queen in public, since the famous 10th of April, when English loyalty and English "" pluck "" had pretty clearly shown that England could have nothing to fear from the revolutionary elements which were just then rife in Europe, driving monarchs from their thrones. When the British Sovereign first reappeared among her subjects, loyalty was not to be baulked of a fitting de- monstration; and in spite of the etiquette of the day, which allowed the Queen, as well as her subjects, to enjoy a dramatic entertainment without interruption, she was received by such universal homage of acclamation, that she was constrained to appear in the front of her box to acknowledge the demonstration, whilst the the National Anthem was sung by the chief singers of the establishment. Well might the newspapers of the day preface their record by the phrase, ""The great evening of the season has come off, and the result has been most brilliant.""",http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/day/1848-05-04,,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/3b87d85fa3d79cf60f5b00326058d77e/1438764760066,Accompanied Public Indoor,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Benjamin+Lumley/1438607277398 http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Queen+Victoria/1393599242108,Benjamin Lumley Queen Victoria,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

Scarcely less triumphant was she in her third character. ""The worshippers of Jenny Lind — and their name is legion"" — to quote the general phraseology of the newspapers of the day — ""were supplied with fresh excitement by the appearance of the Swedish Nightingale in a new character — one in which she had been wonderfully successful on the Continent — that of Maria, in Donizetti's 'Figlia del Reggimento'. ""The music of this opera, one of Donizetti's lightest and prettiest compositions, had already been dished up by fragments to the English public in various forms, though, without much savour. On the boards of the Anglo-Italian stage, however, it seemed entirely new; the reminiscences of well-known melodies heightening, perhaps, rather than diminishing the zest with which the audience of Her Majesty's Theatre received the opera. The novel charm bestowed on it by such a ""cast,"" and by an admirable performance throughout of the music, established ""La Figlia"" at once in favour. The acting of Jenny Lind, as the simple-minded and impulsive Vivandiere, struggling against the trammels of conventional ""fine-lady"" life, again made a lively impression ; whilst the warmth and feeling with which she sang, with wonderfully elaborate execution, one of her airs, established the character as another of Jenny's triumphs.",1847-uu-uu,,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/f4ff85c20792d00fe2014992f1d2b65d/1438704703157,Public Accompanied Indoor,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Benjamin+Lumley/1438607277398,Benjamin Lumley,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

Miss HARRIETT YOUNG, the author of several popular songs, was a brilliant amateur pianist.

I remember hearing her in the MENDELSSOHN D minor trio at PROFESSOR, D'ALQUEN'S one night, and being much overcome by my feelings at the wild and magnificent close, I turned to a musician who was standing close to me and exclaimed, ""'Tis like going up to heaven by a whirlwind!""

Siegfried Wagner came twice to London. In the autumn of 1894 he challenged criticism as a conductor only, and was “let off” pretty lightly. He &nbsp;wielded the baton with his left hand, but his beat &nbsp;was firm and distinct, and his readings, if colorless, were intelligent and clear. In the summer of&nbsp;1895 he appeared as a composer, and presented to &nbsp;the world, for the first time, a symphonic poem written after Schiller's “Sehnsucht. ""This work revealed promise, but it was “the promise of the &nbsp;child who tries to run before he can walk, the prematurely exposed talent of the artist who represents on canvas some great problem of human life &nbsp;before he has mastered the art of mixing his colors."" At the same concert he gave a practical &nbsp;demonstration of his father's ideas concerning the&nbsp;interpretation of Beethoven's “little” symphony in &nbsp;F.

There is no such other ‘Zigeuner’ band in the whole country. When Liszt was here he kept them playing half through the night.” And so did I! I half-ruined myself over them. Never have I spent money so recklessly - felt I really could not bear to let them go.

He was engaged by Sir Henry Irving to sing “Sigh no more Ladies,” when he produced Much Ado about Nothing at the Lyceum (his mother, of course, called it “Much Ado about Nothing at all”), and the way he sang that song was certainly among the most attractive things in the performance.

Several of these animals were lying on the hearth, and he assured my father that if he would sing a short strain, the cat would awaken and show signs of pleasure ; and if the music were Handel's the experiment would be sure to succeed.

The movement was very slow — very nearly twice as slow as it is common to sing the Old Hundredth in our American churches, so that the time was easily described by counting four to each note, or eight in a double measure. No leading voice was heard; the organ alone seemed to lead, and yet the singing and the playing were so nearly together that no unpleasant effect was produced. It is always better that the organ should lead, than that a single voice should be heard ahead of others; but, there is, indeed, no necessity for either, even in Congregational singing, and the idea that a single voice should lead a choir by being always a little in advance in time, is so entirely at variance with good taste that it is not to be tolerated. The singing was in unison, and the times seemed to be perfectly familiar. The tune was not played over upon the organ before the singing, but the organist played only a prelude of a few measures, when all the people joined at once in the hymn. The interludes were very short; indeed, they could hardly be called interludes in the ordinary sense, since they were too short to include even a single phrase; they consisted only of a passing chord or two, merely allowing time to breathe between the stanzas.&nbsp;
We have already intimated that the singing was very general in the congregation; in this respect, we think the Dutch congregations are in advance even of the German; for there was one universal burst of vocal sound from the beginning to the end of the hymn. No other musical form was attempted than that of the plain metrical time, or chorale.",1853-Ee-uu,"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Grote_Kerk,_Haarlem",http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/0795f16f52860dbaabcdd900a83f64c3/1462038192218,Indoor Public Accompanied,http://musicbrainz.org/artist/f422b99a-b48c-4bee-bc0c-f2e8cad82b6c#_,Dr. Lowell Mason Lowell Mason,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pipe_organ http://data.open.ac.uk/led/thing/congregation,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_music

Our Quintette Club was engaged to play with Ole Bull for a week. He was requested to play first violin in one of Mozart’s quintettes,— a first movement only. We had to stand up while playing it. To sit down and play was an impossibility for the heroic Ole. At the time of the first Jubilee in Boston, he and Carl Rosa played at the first desk of violins. We all thought it noble of him to take part.
Ole Bull had all the fine traits of the successful player. After each of his performances there was usually great applause. When he came out on the stage to acknowledge the compliment, his manner was so uncommonly graceful, so stately-courteous, as he bowed right and left, that the audience was, if possible, more completely captured than when he was playing to them",184u-uu-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boston,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/7229b864f556944b3561736603a9c3e7/1450214024565,Public Indoor Accompanied,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Thomas+Ryan/1448997315048,Thomas Ryan,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Violin,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_music

Guided by the twilight, and shortly afterwards by the beams of the moon, which seemed to rise most majestically amid a crowd of stars, which appeared far more brilliant and numerous than in our climate, I followed a path which I supposed would lead me into the road to Fiesole [a town near Florence]; when suddenly I distinguished the sounds of rustic music, amongst which I heard the notes of the bagpipe, the guitar, and the zampogna&nbsp;[the Italian bagpipe].&nbsp;Attracted by the charm of this melody, than which, when well executed by the rustic performers in the depth of a wood, and amid the solitude of night, nothing can be more agreeable, I beheld all at once a light shining through the trees. This led me to the place where the rural concert was, and, guided by its light, I arrived at a fountain, or rather a chapel, for beneath an arch, supported by columns, I saw a painting of the Virgin and the Infant Jesus, surrounded by cherubims and prostrate angels. An abundant stream fell from a sculptured lion's head which frowned under the painting, and flowed into the reservoirs which were placed at the sides of the edifice. A lamp, suspended from the centre of the arch, rendered the scene still more interesting. A whole family were imploring the Divine grace for the recovery of an infant which its mother held in her arms, covering it with tears and kisses; the other members of the family were praying with fervour, or chanting hymns which they accompanied with their instruments.
If the reader can imagine the mingling of voices and music, most simple and harmonious, with the sound of the dancing waters flowing over the stones and along the green turf—the light of the moon through the foliage—the clear lustre of the lamp which gilded the figure of the virgin in the niche, and shone in the reflexion of the crystal and moving waters, shedding at the same time a light over the actors of this pious scene—if he can imagine this scene more impressive as it was unexpected, and so sweetly harmonizing with those serious sensations which filled my heart—he will even then have only a weak idea of the impression which I experienced.&nbsp;
At my approach, the good people rose from their prayers, but I begged that I might mingle my intercessions with theirs. The hymn was recommenced, and the voices of the young girls, joined to those of musicians of every age, made one of the most delicious concerts I ever enjoyed.",17uu-Ll-uuTLl:ll:ll,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/f3eb4d29f19d56b7e19e8fa973a480e6,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/f62c9da09c6a77c46b7e24ea34fd015e/1517908819858,Public Solitary Outdoor,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Antoine+Laurent+Castellan/1517842957331,Antoine-Laurent Castellan,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zampogna http://dbpedia.org/resource/Female_vocals http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bagpipes http://dbpedia.org/resource/Guitar,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hymn

As Amina in the ""Sonnambula,"" she had an even more difficult trial to sustain. The part was considered the best, as it had been the most celebrated of all the great impersonations of Jenny Lind, whose last performance of it was recent in the memory of all the habitues of Her Majesty's Theatre. The task of Madame Sontag, under such circumstances, was bold, almost hazardous; but again she triumphed. Her charm in the part was so great, that all thought of comparison was effaced from the minds of her listeners. The new Amina was hailed as rapturously as if no rival — much less one who was considered beyond the reach of competition — had ever existed; and, in spite of all prepossessions, her powers as an actress were now universally declared equal to her finished style as a cantatrice.

""Ernani,"" however, ran on, with its moderate degree of success, for several nights during the ante-Easter season, to be followed by ""Le Desert"" of Felicien David, which was given as a ""musical fete"" on the boards of Her Majesty's Theatre. This ""Grand Symphonic Pastoral Ode"" (as it was denominated) met with a larger amount of ""fair play"" than the opera of Verdi, was very generally treated as an ""extraordinary production"" (not always in the best sense of the term), and was both applauded and to a great extent appreciated. As an ""extra"" entertainment, indeed, it was repeated several times. Felicien David's odd composition, though rather more than a nine days' wonder, was but the wonder of a season. None of his subsequent works have attained an equal degree of celebrity ; and it is recorded of a celebrated composer, who in society is scarcely less celebrated as a wit, that when asked his opinion respecting one of David's late productions, he drily remarked, ""II est descendu de son chameau.""

Dr. Cumming is a very popular preacher; his house is generally crowded, and it is not easy always to obtain seats — which favor, however, we procured, through the politeness of the leader of the singing, Mr. Purday. The order of exercises observed in this church is an excellent one, and I therefore copy it.
&nbsp;
I. Singing — a Hymn by the Congregation.
II. Prayer, half as long as the Prayer usually is in Presbyterian Churches.
III. Choir Singing. An Anthem.
IV. Reading Scriptures, with Exposition.
V. Hymn, sung by the Congregation.
VI. Prayer, about the length of the first.
VII. Sermon.
VIII. Singing by Congregation. Notices.
IX. Concluding Prayer, and Benediction.
&nbsp;
The standing position was observed in the singing exercises, and the sitting posture in all others. I will not attempt to report the sermon, but will only observe that one more plain, faithful, and edifying can hardly be imagined. The text was
“It is good for me to draw near unto God.”
It will be observed that the singing exercise occurs four times; thrice by the congregation, and once by the choir exclusively. The people generally united, although the tunes, (with the exception of the last, which was York,) were too difficult to justify the expectation of the best congregational singing. The old tune of Martyrdom was sung; but in singing it, the people could not keep together, on account of the triple measure, and the crotchets in the fourth line. The other tune (we do not know its name) was so high that many could not reach the pitch. A congregational tune should not go higher than D, or E flat.",1852-08-Ee,http://dbpedia.org/resource/London,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/267ed5f6ce4501c1b787c564e578dda5/1448394586494,Accompanied Indoor Public,http://musicbrainz.org/artist/f422b99a-b48c-4bee-bc0c-f2e8cad82b6c#_,Dr. Lowell Mason Lowell Mason,Performance,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/thing/congregation,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hymn

The great painter [Sir John E. Millais] was devoted to music; in fact to be a musician was to be certain of his sympathy. On more than one occasion he said to me, “I love the profession.” He happened to be at St. James’s Hall the night that Mrs. Hutchinson introduced four songs of mine - settings from Tennyson’s “In Memoriam” at a Monday Pop. She sang them beautifully, with great tenderness and feeling, and she looked so charming into the bargain (“ce qui n’a jamais gâté rien”) that it is no wonder she made a success of them. We had studied them carefully together, and I accompanied her that night. How grateful one feels to the really unselfish singer who enters heart and soul into the spirit of one’s composition, and how much one owes them! I am sure I owed the pleasure of knowing Sir John Millais in a great measure to the touching way Mrs. Hutchinson sang “’Tis better to have loved and lost,” for he liked it so much that he asked someone to introduce me to him shortly afterwards.",18Ll-uu-uu,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/3b962f54bdc7412b74ef8c5a33f2c358,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/4037c33141a06afdc104ab417d3bf2d5/1450872493243,Accompanied Public Indoor,http://musicbrainz.org/artist/eca4d562-1e5c-409a-89fa-5489d102cdcb#_,Maude V.

Dr. Joachim's ""exercise"" consisted of his fine overture in memory of the celebrated poet Heinrich von Kleist, which was played under his own direction.

This beautiful work was written for and brought out at the Leeds Festival of 1886. There can be no doubt that it immensely enhanced the reputation of the composer, whose genius as a writer of comic operas had been brilliantly exemplified eighteen months before by the production of “The Mikado”. The laurels yielded by the Savoy operas were of necessity shared by Sir Arthur with his talented collaborator, Mr. W. S. Gilbert. In regard to the Leeds cantata, the composer certainly owed much to Longfellow's lovely poem and to Mr. Joseph Bennett's adroit adaptation thereof; but, this apart, there was no one to divide with him the glory of a supreme triumph, of an artistic achievement that stood “head and shoulders” above all his previous efforts. The overwhelming success at Leeds was the more remarkable in that it came at the close of the greatest festival ever held there— following new works of such calibre as Dvorak's oratorio “St. Ludmila,"" A. C. Mackenzie's cantata “The Story of Sayid”, and Villiers Stanford's fine choral ballad “The Revenge,"" not to speak of a phenomenal performance by the Yorkshire chorus of Bach's great Mass in B minor, never before attempted at a provincial festival. The most tremendous ovation of all, though, was that which greeted the composer of ""The Golden Legend"" when he laid down his baton at the close of the noble choral epilogue. Such ringing British cheers had not been heard in that magnificent hall since Queen Victoria opened it in the ""fifties.""",1886-uu-uu,,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/0486fd4cc697241ada65d1659a674e69/1438266027617,Public Accompanied Indoor,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Hermann+Klein/1438157240872,Hermann Klein,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cantata

Nevertheless, it seemed to me that the wonderful excerpt was fairly well played, though I was too breathless with amazement and admiration to be able to form a cool judgment.

A regiment with a complete band came to our post I was on the watch for their first rehearsal; I begged father to take me to it He and I entered the room just as the band was beginning to play the overture to Fra Diavolo. The drum solo with which it begins transfixed me, but when the trumpet solo at the opening allegro began, I screamed with delight and father had to put his hand over my mouth to keep me from disturbing the musicians.

&nbsp;&nbsp; Surely none who heard that magnificent performance of the Manzoni “Requiem"" can have ever forgotten the combined effect of the beautiful music, the superb singing of the Albert Hall choir (trained by Barnby), the wonderful voices of the soloists, and, pervading all, the subtle magnetic influence induced by the presence and personal guidance of the composer. The solo artists included three members of the original quartet, namely: Mme. Stolz, Mme. Waldmann, and Signor Masini. All possessed noble organs ; and the famous tenor, who has never been heard in opera in England, was then quite at his best. But the undoubted gem of the whole performance was the “Agnus Dei”, with its octave unison phrases for the two women's voices, sung by Stolz and Waldmann with a delicacy and charm of simply ethereal loveliness. Nor shall I forget the pains taken by Verdi at rehearsal to obtain from his chorus and orchestra of eight hundred a pianissimo in fitting proportion to the exquisite tone of these singers.

'The music was very fine — ' the Creation,'—Spohr's ' Fall of Babylon' (a musical drama, called oratorio) —and 'Samson.' The text of the latter had been modified by Mr. Edward Taylor, so as to coincide with and comprehend that of Milton almost entirely, incorporating the newly-introduced portions by interspersing other Handelian passages, selected from his forgotten works, whether operas, or small and little noticed oratorios. According to Mr. Taylor, Handel had adopted a movement from Palestrina, and worked out a passage of ' Samson ' upon that guiding-thread : this suggested and gave occasion for the introduction of a hymn, founded upon an inexpressibly fine conception of Palestrina's. Nobody was aware of this, and all declared it to be the most striking part; the Bishop caused it to be repeated, and the whole assembly (above 2,000 in number) rose and remained standing, as during devotional pieces. After this piece, the greatest effect was produced by a short chorus, which no one had heard before : and that was, equally from the Septime, borrowed from Carissimo. This system of intercalation is in itself indefensible : but I must confess that the text, as it is, has a fine effect : the action progresses dramatically, and nothing could be easier than to make a representation with entire dramatic effect of this ' Samson' : an idea for which I sought to obtain acceptance.'",1842-09-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Norwich,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/http://data.open.ac.uk/led/music/Chorus/1434011819863/1434011819874,Accompanied Indoor,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Christian_Charles_Josias_von_Bunsen http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Lord+Northampton/1434011412831 http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Mrs+Baring/1434011460627 http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Lady+Williams/1434011428422 http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Miss+Trotter/1434011441952,"Christian Charles Josias, Baron von Bunsen Baron von Bunsen Christian Karl Josias von Bunsen Christian Charles Josias von Bunsen Lord Northampton Mrs Baring Lady Williams Miss Trotter",Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vocal_music http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chorale

MR. GARDNER, of Leicester, writes: ""At the hazard of my ribs, I placed myself at the Opera two hours and a half before the concert began The concert opened with BEETHOVEN'S second symphony, admirably played by the Philharmonic band, after which LABLACHE sang 'Largo al Factotum' with much applause, and was encored. A breathless silence, and every eye was watching the action of this extraordinary violinist; and as he glided from the side scenes to the front of the stage, an involuntary cheering burst from every part of the house, many rising from their scats to view the Spectre during the thunder of this unprecedented cheering his gaunt and extraordinary appearance being more like that of a devotee about to suffer martyrdom than one to delight you with his art. With the tip of his bow he sent off the orchestra in a grand military movement with a force and vivacity as surprising as it was new. At the termination of this introduction he commenced with a soft streaming note of celestial quality, and with three or four whips of his bow elicited points of sound that mounted to the third heaven and as bright as the stars... He has long legs and arms, and his hands in his playing often assume the attitude of prayer, with the fingers pointed upwards. It was curious to watch the faces of LINDLEY, DIAGONETTI, and the other great players, who took up places on the platform to command a good view of him during his performance they all seem to have agreed that &nbsp;the like had never been heard before, and that in addition to his marvellous eccentricities and novel effects, he had transcended the highest level of legitimate art that had ever been reached.""",1831-05-uu,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/047e04d3a9e41d21aa7be1fe47f29a19,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/c3a78b808755df7afd5131e8b71b99d0/1437844349226,Indoor Accompanied Public,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Concert+audience/1437737637011,Concert audience,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Symphony

They consist of vocal and instrumental music, but without orchestra. They employ some five or six solo performers, and a choir of about forty-five choristers. Glees and madrigals are sung by the choir, and songs, duets, &amp;c., by the solo voices, with piano forte pieces, violin pieces, or other instruments as it may be convenient to obtain for the different concerts. I attended the second of the series on Thursday last. The large Exeter Hall was full of people, who seemed to be much delighted with the music; indeed I thought that there was more warmth of approval exhibited there than we usually see at the best concerts with us. The solo performers were Miss Pyne, Miss Louisa Pyne, Miss Binckes, Mr. Swift, (a new tenor,) Herr Jonghmans, Mr. Cotton, and Mr. Whitworth. Miss Goddard played serenade (Don Pasquale), by Thalberg, and also an andante and rondo capricioso by Mendelssohn, on the piano forte, and Mr. Richardson played an air with variations on the flute. Miss Binckes has a very fine voice, and sung to the great acceptance of the audience, and Miss Louisa Pyne sung quite a difficult aria by Rode, which called forth a most enthusiastic encore. The pieces for full choir were performed without accompaniment, not even the piano forte being played; and although I have heard a better chorus at home, yet this was truly good. The concert was conducted by Mr. T. H. Severn. The programme contained the music to the National Anthem, printed in full in four parts, and the whole audience joined in this the closing chorus:
&nbsp;
“God save our gracious Queen,
Long may Victoria reign;
God save the Queen!
Send her victorious,
Happy and glorious,
Long to reign over us,
God save the Queen!
&nbsp;
""O Lord our God arise,
Scatter her enemies,
And make them fall.
Confound their politics,
Frustrate their knavish tricks,
On Thee our hopes we fix,
God save us all.
&nbsp;
""Thy choicest gifts in store&nbsp;

Long may she reign;
May she defend our laws,
And ever give us cause,

But so determined was he to give me my chance that he absolutely attacked the audience with the splendour of his singing, with the magnetism of his personality. It was like a tidal wave sweeping everything before it, and of course he carried the crowd away with him and won the day for me, for the song was received very differently the second time he sang it.

The musicians were a splendid set. He had Bottesini, the Paganini of the contrabass, and Koenig, the great cornetist of the day, who could play with wonderful expression, his rendition of the Prima Donna Waltz being really an artistic marvel. Then there was the oboist, Lavigne, playing with exquisite tone and fine technique, who could hold a tone (it was said) all the evening by breathing through his nostrils while playing. Then there was the necromantic flautist, Reichardt, the very fine clarinetist, Wuille, and an ophicleide- player, Mr. Hughes, who drew out of his instrument a wonderfully soft, large, and mellow tone, and played with great execution. Among the first violins were the brothers Mollenhauer, who were famous as players of duets, and who finally settled in this country.

'The music was very fine — ' the Creation,'—Spohr's ' Fall of Babylon' (a musical drama, called oratorio) —and 'Samson.' The text of the latter had been modified by Mr. Edward Taylor, so as to coincide with and comprehend that of Milton almost entirely, incorporating the newly-introduced portions by interspersing other Handelian passages, selected from his forgotten works, whether operas, or small and little noticed oratorios. According to Mr. Taylor, Handel had adopted a movement from Palestrina, and worked out a passage of ' Samson ' upon that guiding-thread : this suggested and gave occasion for the introduction of a hymn, founded upon an inexpressibly fine conception of Palestrina's. Nobody was aware of this, and all declared it to be the most striking part; the Bishop caused it to be repeated, and the whole assembly (above 2,000 in number) rose and remained standing, as during devotional pieces. After this piece, the greatest effect was produced by a short chorus, which no one had heard before : and that was, equally from the Septime, borrowed from Carissimo. This system of intercalation is in itself indefensible : but I must confess that the text, as it is, has a fine effect : the action progresses dramatically, and nothing could be easier than to make a representation with entire dramatic effect of this ' Samson' : an idea for which I sought to obtain acceptance.'",1842-09-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Norwich,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/http://data.open.ac.uk/led/music/The+Creation/1432997165184/1434011551316,Accompanied Indoor,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Christian_Charles_Josias_von_Bunsen http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Miss+Trotter/1434011441952 http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Lady+Williams/1434011428422 http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Lord+Northampton/1434011412831 http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Mrs+Baring/1434011460627,"Christian Charles Josias, Baron von Bunsen Baron von Bunsen Christian Karl Josias von Bunsen Christian Charles Josias von Bunsen Miss Trotter Lady Williams Lord Northampton Mrs Baring",Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chorale http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oratorio http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vocal_music http://dbpedia.org/resource/Religious_music

Mr. Gilmore was a modest and a wise man, and conducted but little of the music himself; but that little was great,—for did he not direct the “Anvil Chorus ” ? Will Boston, or at least its Jubilee participators, ever forget the sensation it had when the one hundred firemen—each in his belt, helmet, and red flannel shirt, carrying a long-handled blacksmith’s hammer at “ right shoulder shift ” like a musket—marched into the hall and on to the stage in two files of fifty, and then separated far enough to form a red frame for two sides of the orchestra, which meanwhile was playing the introduction to the “Anvil Chorus ” ? Reaching their special, real anvils, the firemen faced the audience, lifted their hammers to the proper position, and at the right musical moment played and sang the melody.
If ever “the welkin rang” it did then !
In addition to the sounds from a hundred anvils there was the great organ, military band, drum corps, all the bells in the city achime, and a cannon accompaniment. This last came from two batteries of well served guns stationed at a short distance from the building, and a gun was fired off by electricity on the first beat of each measure. A small table was placed on the stage, close to the director, with a set of electric buttons, each having a wire leading to a gun. Mr. John Mullaly was the artist who pressed the button; the gun did the rest. These guns were similarly used for all national airs.
At the termination of the “Anvil Chorus ” there was enormous applause. The whole mass of people rose to their feet, jumped up and down, and nearly dislocated their arms by waving handkerchiefs, fans, hats, parasols, even babies. I am sure that I was never in any great assembly where such wild, almost frantic cheering and applause was heard. Fifty thousand people in a wooden building can make some noise.
The dear, wonderful old maestro, Verdi, did certainly furnish a great opportunity for P. S. Gilmore. It is equally certain that Verdi never dreamed of the possibilities contained in the “ of time began to pound the anvils,—right, left, right, left,— while the great orchestra and chorus slam-bang ” popular melody. When the piece was ended, the gentlemen firemen would march out; and, the applause continuing, they would march back again and go through the whole exciting performance once more.",180u-Ll-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boston,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/8c9fe37be8432ad74bed2aeb6c99c7e6/1450281177648,Indoor Public Accompanied,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Thomas+Ryan/1448997315048,Thomas Ryan,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Drum http://dbpedia.org/resource/Military_band http://dbpedia.org/resource/Organ_(music),http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

I thoroughly enjoyed the one opera I heard in Petersburg - Glinka’s La Vie pour le Czar. I love the Russian language, which, when sung, sounds to me particularly soft, and full of charm, and it was during that performance that I saw a polonaise danced for the first time. It roused me to absolute enthusiasm. I never saw anything more graceful than the way, at the end of the dance, each man threw himself at the feet of his partner.

Perhaps no circumstance has tended to improve our theatrical music so much as the visit of these Germans. The excellence of their performance was to be attributed to the taste and skill of the conductor. Heretofore our bands have been led and directed by the first violin, who, when difficulties occurred, desisted from playing, and, by the flourish of his bow, endeavoured to keep his troops together. On the appearance of a new opera, the person who presided at the piano-forte had the charge of the chorus, so that the two directors were often beating two different times. Besides the movement being thus tortured, the superior execution of the first violin was withdrawn at the moment it was most needed. The German method has put an end to these ridiculous exhibitions, by placing a person of taste and talent in front, who directs every movement and expression.",1833-uu-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/London,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/http://data.open.ac.uk/led/music/Freischutz/1435440840354/1435440840377,Accompanied Indoor Public,http://bnb.data.bl.uk/id/person/GardinerWilliam1770-1853,William  Gardiner William Gardiner,Performance,,

In 1853, Madame Sontag came to Boston with a brilliant company, Carl Eckert being the conductor. When the Sontag party first arrived in America they had with them the fine boy violinist, Paul Jullien. I think he was about fifteen years of age at that time. He played mainly Alard and Leonard pieces, and played them very brilliantly. When the company had made a limited concert tour, attended with indifferent success, it was reorganized into an operatic enterprise and the boy violinist returned to Europe. I think his career was closed by death.
I remember distinctly Sontag in her best role, “ La Fille du Regiment” She was a most attractive picture in her vivandiire costume, with the drum hanging from her neck by a “ sling,” and as she was a good drummer she won enormous success. She was certainly a fine actress and an excellent singer.",1853-uu-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boston,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/22cda63e695a836a3449da5b832e01d8/1450273639284,Indoor Accompanied Public,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Thomas+Ryan/1448997315048,Thomas Ryan,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Female_vocals,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

Here we heard an excellent and faithful sermon. The spirit of Newton, or rather die spirit of the Gospel, is jet manifested within these walls. The singing was led by about a dozen charity children; the girls being dressed as the old ladies of New England used to dress half a century ago, each having a square handkerchief folded about the neck, a high white muslin cap, and a white apron. The chants were plain, and tolerably well done, and so were the tunes, — all the people singing. The organist played very long interludes; in several cases the interludes were one quarter longer than the tune itself. They were tedious, and in bad taste; otherwise the organ was well played.

Anticipating this, our company, consisting of three persons, went a little before the time appointed for the opening of the door; but yet we found a crowd gathered; the room filled immediately as the door was opened, but we succeeded in obtaining good seats. We had now to wait a full hour before the music commenced, but in the midst of such a multitude of good-looking and well-dressed ladies and gentlemen, all in conversation in loud and merry voices, it soon passed away. Half an hour before the commencement, the oboe was heard, running the scales, &amp;c.; this was soon followed by faggotti, corni, clarionetti, and strings; every man tuning and getting his instrument and his fingers in readiness. Mendelssohn seemed to look down from his bust immediately opposite the orchestra with approbation. At half-past six precisely, Kapelmeister Rietz takes his stand — the signal is given — every one is silent and attentive, and Beethoven’s overture (op. 124) fills the whole company with delight. This is a very pleasing overture; it is less learned, but of a more popular character than most of Beethoven’s. It is often marked with a rhythm like the music of the march or dance; and the flourishes of the brass instruments and drums almost lead one to suppose that he is listening to a military band. But still the hand of the master is seen, and although Beethoven comes down and freely holds conversation with the people, yet he always preserves his dignity, and never dishonors his profession in this pleasing composition.
A very good singer followed; Frau Leopoldine Tuczek-Herrenburg, from Berlin, in a Recitative and Arie from the opera of “Sylvana,” by C. Maria von Weber.
This was followed by a grand Concerto for the Piano Forte, with orchestral accompaniment (G moll), composed by J. Moschelles, and played by Clara Schumann. I have already spoken of Madame Schumann’s playing; her performance of this Concerto was perfect, and received the warmest approbation from the audience.
An air of De Beriot followed, by Frau Tuczek-Herrenburg; after which Madame Schumann played most charmingly a Notturno (B. major) for piano forte, by F. Chopin. In this she was encored, and played in answer to the call another piece unknown to the writer.
The second part of the concert was that in which the musical ones were most deeply interested, for it consisted of Robert Schumann's new Symphonie. This has not been published, and was played from manuscript, conducted by the author, who was cordially greeted on his appearance at the head of the orchestra. It is undoubtedly a work of great merit; but it is truly a great work, and can only be performed by a very thoroughly trained band. Its analogies and correspondencies are deeper and more hidden than in Mozart or Beethoven, but nevertheless they are there, and can be discovered to some extent even at a first hearing. The Symphonie consists of five movements, there being in addition to the usual movements a short adagio (fourth) introduced. In the second movement (scherzo), there is playfulness and relief, but throughout the whole the idea of greatness prevails; so much so as almost to oppress one with a feeling of grandeur and sublimity. The fourth movement especially seems to partake in the highest degree of this character, and stirs up the deep feelings to awe and reverence. But vain is any attempt at description, especially by one who has heard it but at a single performance. It was played with great energy; every member of the orchestra had enough to do. The captain inspired confidence, and the result was most satisfactory. There was but a momentary pause between the parts, and in this respect the learned conductor’s example is well worthy of imitation. The Symphonie occupied thirty-three minutes in its performance, and at half-past eight the concert closed.",http://data.open.ac.uk/time/interval/1852-03-uuT18:30:00/to/1852-03-uuT20:30:00,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/0a19459865ed69275723d6efb76048c9,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/6aaa3e4c8cd5a0a8e4d9a6f14337c90c/1448309982975,Indoor Accompanied Public,http://musicbrainz.org/artist/f422b99a-b48c-4bee-bc0c-f2e8cad82b6c#_,Dr. Lowell Mason Lowell Mason,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Female_vocals http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

We had also visits from ballet companies, at that time very much in vogue. It would doubtless be a strange entertainment for the present age. Imagine people being now asked to spend two or three hours witnessing a play in “ dumb show ” ; though good pantomimic action, artistic dancing, fine scenery, and the best of instrumental music were given.

The band was in the most perfect order, and the programme was unusually attractive; though great variety of music, both with respect to authorship and character, is always presented to the patrons of this celebrated series of concerts. The Symphonie was by Mozart in Eb major; it is less noisy, flighty and diffuse than some more modem compositions, but not less intelligible or beautiful. The adagio is particularly melodious, elegant and attractive.
A scene and arie from “Orpheus,” by Gluck, followed. Gluck is a decided favorite here, and especially as a dramatic writer stands among the very first.
The third piece was a concerto for violin, by Beethoven, performed by Herr Concertmeister F. David. This concerto, worthy the reputation of its author, was finely rendered by the violinist, and received with a hearty applause. It is very long, but it does not tire for it is full of variety, and there is enough to admire, both in the principal and in the accompaniment. Two quite long cadenzas, composed by the performer, containing each an ingenious recapitulation of the thoughts, or rather allusion to the various figures of the movement in which the cadenza occurred, were introduced, with excellent taste and skill.
The second part of the concert consisted of “Die erste Walpurgisnacht,” a ballad by Goethe, set to music by Mendelssohn. A choir of about one hundred and fifty voices sang the choruses (and there is much chorus in the piece) with admirable promptness and energy. The music is difficult, both for vocalists and instrumentalists; it is one of Mendelssohn’s strong pieces, and is full of his peculiar harmonies. It is mostly very loud, with an abundance of instruments of noise, and extra double drums for earthquake, volcano, and thunder; though there is most acceptable relief in occasional piano passages. Although Mendelssohn does not belong to the noisy school, yet he has shown in the Walpurgisnacht, that if he had chosen to do so he might have cast quite into the shade, or thundered out of existence, all the Verdis of modern times.",1852-03-Mm,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/0a19459865ed69275723d6efb76048c9,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/03aec197c167f20bcee68f055c643949/1448285881017,Accompanied Public Indoor,http://musicbrainz.org/artist/f422b99a-b48c-4bee-bc0c-f2e8cad82b6c#_,Dr. Lowell Mason Lowell Mason,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra http://dbpedia.org/resource/Choir,

Sontag is gone, and the Gewandhaus Orchestra is thrown upon its own strength and resources; but it fails not, neither is it faint or weary. The Eighteenth Concert was (save the charming singer) one of the very best of the season. The Orchestra (said one who has often heard) never played better; well might they feel the inspiration of their author, for they played Beethoven's 4th Symphonic, than which he has not written a better. It is not so well known in America, but it cannot rank second to anything which Beethoven has composed.
The adagio (sextuple movement) is as perfect in design and as beautiful in coloring as in any work of musical art. Fraulein Anna Klassig sang a Recitative and Arie from Sphor's Jessonda. Herr G. Kruger, from Stuttgart, played two pieces well on the Harp; and a well-trained choir, Pauliner Sänger-Vereins, of fifty men’s voices sung three pieces, two of which were by Mendelssohn, and one of which may be found in the “Fireside Harmony” (Waserfahrt.) Mendelssohn’s Overture ""Melusine,"" as fine an Overture as exists, was played; and the performance was worthy of the composition.

The congregation consisted of at least some twelve hundred persons.

Two stanzas were sung, each taking four minutes. At the close of the second stanza, the organist, continuing to play, changed gradually his key to A minor, closing an intermediate voluntary of about three minutes, diminishing to pianissimo so as to hush the house to perfect silence; then, after a moment’s pause, the people joined again to the lead of the organ, in the fine old choral beginning as follows: e, a g, f e, d—, e—, &amp;c. Four stanzas were sung of three minutes each. Here, then, were two hymns sung in connection; which, with the organ prelude and interlude occupied full half-an-hour in the performance. Men’s voices predominated, marking in strength the bold outlines of the tune; while female voices were heard and seemed to come in echoing, enriching, beautifying, and rendering that charming and lovely which otherwise would have been too severely grand and majestic.

&nbsp;*The villa Santa Anna is the favourite summer-residence of the Marchesa Theresa Pallavicini. We were present there at one of the most picturesque fêtes that can well be imagined, and in which Religion accidentally mingled her rites, with a very singular effect. It was the feast of Saint Anne—the saint-day of the younger Marchioness (daughter-in-law to Madame Pallavicini), in honour of whom the entertainment was given. As we were carried up the steep and dark acclivities, on the summit of which the villa and its gardens, brilliantly illuminated, blazed like meteors, we observed several little shrines, erected by the votarists of the Saint, lighted with wax tapers and decorated with flowers. Bands of children and young women sang&nbsp;choruses, and suffered them to fade away in dying cadences, which were taken up by other groups, and echoed back.
&nbsp;The entertainment at the villa was a concert, ball, and supper—the two latter under an awning,and in the open air, delicious from the softness of evening and the profusion of flowers. About midnight the moon rose,—and the Bay, with its shipping—the Apennines—a light-house—a fortress—the town beneath, all touched with silver rays, or partially bid in deep shadows, completed the scene.",18Ee-uu-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Genoa,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/7c3d6b0ec781644b93815ae08a4096d7/1515701216901,Outdoor Public Accompanied Domestic,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Lady+Sydney+Morgan/1515698191138,Lady Sydney Morgan,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/musicgenre/sacred+vocal

At a short distance is a villa […] called the Boschetto, as being on the most woody spot in the island, and is watered by an abundant spring. Being uninhabited, it exhibits a melancholy appearance. The domain about it abounds in game. During the summer an annual festival is held here, by the peasantry of the island, who, with their brides, spend a most joyous day. According to description, the scene must be equally striking and agreeable. In the valley, beneath the Boschetto, is a large grove of orange trees, under each of which is a party of countrymen, with their wives, children, beasts, &amp;c. attended by music, and forming numberless picturesque groupes. Attendance at this festival is considered of so much importance by the females, that it is even said to form a clause in marriage contracts.

*On the retreat of the Austrians, the youth of Bologna, to the number of 300 or 400, offered their services to Murat.

In the season of 1844-45, that Society brought out the Scotch Symphony and the Midsummer Night's Dream overture, by Mendelssohn.
[…]
We must remember that fifty years ago there were not many professional musicians of sufficient technical ability to cope with Me-delssohn’s music, which even to-day is classified as difficult. Our orchestra was made up half of amateurs and half of professionals. We could have no lightning-express trains in tempo; most music was played tempo commodo.
[…]
Well, we tried it. Our conductor was Mr. Geo. J. Webb,—an excellent general musician, but who had never heard the overture. He began by telling us that he had no score; so he stood up alongside of the first-violin desk and prepared to conduct. Rapping on the desk, he gave the signal to begin; out piped two flutes,—nothing else. He rapped again, implying that the players had not been ready to begin; then he said, “We will try again.” He gave the signal—and out piped the two flutes. That caused a little titter of surprise, and we all looked quizzically at each other. Mr. Webb, however, dutifully gave the signal for the next “ hold ” or chord, when two clarinets joined the two flutes! More surprise. At the third hold (chord) the fagotti and horns were added, and at the fourth hold (chord) the entire wood and wind instruments, all sounding most distressingly out of tune. This dissonant and unlooked-for result was followed by a dead pause; then every one of the players broke out with a hearty laugh of derision.
I was on pins and needles and muttered, “ Go on, go on! ” After a while the people sobered down, and we tried to commence with the string part The first and second violins (each relative part divided into two parts) began at an “accommodation-train” tempo. At the end of the violin passage, the wood and wind again held a very dissonant chord for two measures, which this time sounded so abominably out of tune that it really was as bad as if each man played any note he pleased ; and it was so irresistibly funny that again everybody burst out laughing. But I buried my head under the music desk and cried ; my idol was derided, every one poked fun at me.
That last dissonant chord ended the first rehearsal of the Midsummer Nights Dream overture. We never tried it again.",180u-Ee-uu,,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/0d92b31f945517ca2e48176d234b29cc/1449605804435,Public Indoor Accompanied,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Thomas+Ryan/1448997315048,Thomas Ryan,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flute http://dbpedia.org/resource/Violin http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horn_(instrument) http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clarinet,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_music

He was engaged by Sir Henry Irving to sing “Sigh no more Ladies,” when he produced Much Ado about Nothing at the Lyceum (his mother, of course, called it “Much Ado about Nothing at all”), and the way he sang that song was certainly among the most attractive things in the performance.

Under these favorable circumstances, two new operas by English composers were brought to a hearing, namely, Arthur Goring Thomas's “Esmeralda” and Alexander C. Mackenzie's “Colomba”. It was purely an experiment, and Carl Rosa himself had little faith in its success. I remember his saying: “I look upon this as a duty that I owe to native art, and not as a business speculation. Mind, both these operas are interesting and beautiful, or I should not have accepted them. But they are by British composers— by men whose names are hardly known to the public. How, then, can I dare hope they will succeed?""

The church is a large one, and the stone walls and uncushioned seats are very cold, yet is there no fire found there, save the burning candles on the altar, which, though they shed some light around, afford no warmth. It is not a Papal, but a Protestant church; the Lutherans use the crucifix, candles, &amp;c., though less than the Romanists. There are two galleries, one rising high above the other, each capable of containing, perhaps, five hundred people; so that the church may accommodate, say three thousand, on its three floors. The organ is large, with three rows of keys, pedals, and fifty-four registers.
The exercises commenced punctually at the hour, by a short prelude, played in fine organ style, but not more than about two minutes long. This was followed by a choir piece, sung without any accompaniment, by a choir of men and boys, and without much effect. The choir had not power sufficient for so large a building. An interlude of a few minutes upon the organ followed, when a chorale was sung by the congregation, accompanied with full organ. The congregation was not yet large, but the people were constantly coming in, and it was fast increasing. Still the effect of the general singing was quite animating. This being concluded, the minister began his part of the service, by chanting a short sentence, which was immediately responded to by the choir; and again the minister, and again the response. By this time the church was well filled. From an estimate that I made, I concluded that there could not be less than about twenty-five hundred people present. The organ loft, too, capable of accommodating, perhaps, a hundred, was completely filled with vocal and instrumental performers, including the common orchestral instruments, with trumpets and drums conspicuous. When the slow solemn chant was ended, the organ burst out in a loud minor voluntary, which continued three or four minutes, during which time the violins, violoncellos, double basses, and wind instruments tuned. Yet so carefully was this done, that it was hardly perceptible, for the organ was giving out its full progressive chords, so as to nullify the tuning process, at least upon the ears of the people. Tune being secured, the choir, with organ and orchestra accompaniment, sung a motette, or hymn by Beethoven. This had been announced in the newspapers of Saturday, and was, I suppose, with many an object of attention. It occupied, perhaps, fifteen minutes, and was very well done; the drums and trumpets especially doing fine execution in the great church in the forte passages. It closed with a short fugue, in which the points were distinctly taken up and marked. The choir did not number more than from thirty to forty persons, and had not sufficient power for the building; but still the performance was quite effective. I perceived that while most of the people gave close attention to the music, others were not so much interested, and one goodly-looking old man directly in front of me spent the time in reading over his psalm-book. As soon as the motette was concluded, the members of the orchestra took up their instruments and left the house, having nothing to do with the remaining service. And now came the grand singing — for the great congregation were now together. The organ gave out a choral, when all the people lifted up the loud chorus of praise. The whole house was filled with sound. It was sublime, and I found myself much more moved by this than by the previous choir and orchestra performance. The hymn (486) was indicated on tablets in different parts of the house, and every person had his book in his hand. Even the standers-up in the aisles (for there were hundreds of these) had their books and joined in the song. The singing was in unison; I could not tell, being at the opposite side of the house, whether the choir sang the parts or not; the organ did indeed pour forth full harmony, but even this was vastly overpowered by the multitude of voices — men’s voices, and women’s voices, and children’s voices, mingled in one mighty torrent of sound, rolling through the high arches like the rush of many waters. At the end of each line of the stanza there was an interlude of a few chords upon the organ, but there was no long interlude at the end of the stanza, as in the American churches. Indeed the hymn seemed to flow along from beginning to end, as a whole, and without interruption. I observed, too, that in the hymn-singing I heard in England, the interludes between the stanzas were very short, and often omitted altogether. A very pleasing effect was produced at the close of this and every choral hymn, thus: as soon as the voices ceased on the last word of the last stanza, every head was inclined forward as in the attitude of prayer, while the organ died away piano, in a very short post-lude of perhaps half or three-quarters of a minute, the people retaining their position until the last sound was heard, when they gently resumed an erect posture. After this followed liturgical prayers, read by the clergyman, for a few minutes; and then the chorale was resumed, another stanza or two of the same hymn being sung to the same chorale as before. After this followed the sermon. I did not understand it, but if one might judge by the appearance of the people, it was good, for they all seemed to give close attention for at least three-quarters of an hour.
When the sermon was ended, and a short prayer offered, “Vater unser,” the hymn was resumed again, and still another stanza sung to the same tune as before; so that the same tune was sung three times in the same service. A closing prayer of a few words, and the great congregation gradually dispersed, amid the loud rolling of the diapasons.",1852-03-Ee,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/5acca3a5750f13466563747464ef053e,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/6b026e0c63201fe971a4643120d45ee8/1448287250330,Public Accompanied Indoor,http://musicbrainz.org/artist/f422b99a-b48c-4bee-bc0c-f2e8cad82b6c#_,Dr. Lowell Mason Lowell Mason,Performance,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/thing/congregation http://dbpedia.org/resource/Male_vocals http://dbpedia.org/resource/Female_vocals http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pipe_organ http://dbpedia.org/resource/Choir,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_music

Richter always conducted on Wagner nights, and it was in Vienna that, with the exception of Lohengrin and Tannhaüser, I heard most of his great operas. That is one of the things in my musical life for which I have always been truly grateful. I remember, as though it were but yesterday, the tremendous impression made on me by the performance of Tristan and Isolde. What affected me most of all that first time, was the beautiful music in the second Act where Brangäne keeps watch for the two lovers. It is extraordinarily, almost magically, suggestive. The voice of the faithful friend outside reaches the man and woman—who, in an ecstasy of love, are clasped in each other’s arms - through a wonderful haze of sound that like nothing else I have ever heard suggests not only ineffable, undying love, not only its surroundings during those immemorial hours - the touching beauty of the lovely summer night, the dark-blue, star-strewn sky, the haunting perfume of sweet flowers - but a growing apprehension, a stealthy approach of danger –
“Habet Acht ! Habet Acht ! die Nacht entweicht ! ”
(Beware, beware ! night is waning.)&nbsp;
&nbsp;I have forgotten many beautiful things I have heard, but I could never forget that splendid performance of Tristan and Isolde if I lived to be a hundred years old.

One Saturday afternoon I was sitting by Davison's side as a glorious treat was nearing its close. Joachim had with marvelous fire led one of the “Rasoumowsky"" quartets; he had played the Bach “Chaconne"" as he alone in the world could play it; and now he was taking part in Schumann's noble pianoforte quintet, with Mme. Schumann, Louis Ries, Ludwig Straus, and Piatti for his companions. Just before the finale, the old critic turned to me and said in his abrupt, characteristic way : “”My boy, mind you mark this day with a red letter!

The orchestra consists of about sixty talented musicians, and if Dreyschock and David are not seen leading the violins here as at the Gewandhaus, they, together with the other instruments, string and wind, are in the hands of artists of deservedly high reputation. The selections are also of the highest order, and the Euterpe presents its patrons with the works of the great masters in a style worthy of a Leipzig concert.
At a quarter of an hour before the time of commencement, the members of the orchestra were in their places, talking, tuning and getting ready. This, together with the general conversation of the people assembled, produces a buzzing chorus of great power — a chorus with which the Leipzig concerts commence. Every ticket was sold at an early hour, and of course every seat was occupied.
The concert commenced precisely at the hour appointed, with a new Sinfonie in E flat Major, in manuscript, by W. Westmayer, who conducted the performance. He is a young candidate for fame, who has been educated at the Conservatory here, and who is regarded as already a successful composer. The Sinfonie consisted of four parts, and occupied in its performance exactly thirty-eight minutes. I dare not attempt anything like a particular description of it, or comparison of it with other like compositions; it was listened to with good attention by a discriminating audience, and met a favorable reception. It seemed to me, however, to want light and shade, and variety in the treatment of the different subjects introduced. Parts of it were exceedingly interesting, considered in reference to modern combinations and contrasts of the different orchestral elements, but there was a too constant forte, and a too frequent reiteration of the tonic and dominant harmony, with brass instruments, in military rhythm — this, indeed, is a general resort of such composers as are sometimes at a loss for an idea, or in a similar condition with the public speaker who is obliged to speak, but has nothing in particular to say. I do not mean that Mr. Westmayer was minus thought, but still there was not such a flow as we often find in a Mozart.
The Sinfonie was truly good, and seemed to give much satisfaction — and yet I could not help thinking that it was an excellent preparation for the high appreciation of the next orchestral piece, which was no less an overture than the celebrated No. 2, C Major, to Leonore, and which was given with an effect far beyond what can be often heard.
The overture by C. M. Von Weber, to Oberon, was also played with such an energy and brilliancy as to take one’s breath away. The stillness of the pianos, the gradual and immense range of the crescendos, the thundering power of the fortes, with instantaneous contrasts and startling sfortzandos, were enough to work up the feelings to a perfect phrenzy. Wonderfully effective were these ever favorite overtures by Beethoven and Weber.
It was no small attraction of this concert that the piano forte was played by the Fraulein Maria Wieck, the sister of the celebrated Clara, wife of Robert Schumann. Mdlle. Wieck is a very superior player; she has not the strong hand of a DeMeyer or a Listz, but she has a most finished touch, and plays with great elegance and expression. Her first piece (hear it, oh ye of the exclusive modern school,) was nothing more nor less than Dussek’s 12th Concerto in E fiat major, the Adagio and Allegro movements of which she played — a most beautiful composition, elegant and tasteful in the highest degree, played both by the principal and by the orchestra as near perfection as such things can be done. There is nothing in the music to astonish, or to excite wonder or surprise, but there is that in it which is adapted to call forth perfect delight. It is full of peace, and innocence, and purity, and joy, and it is from beginning to end a constant appeal to the perception of the beautiful. I am no enemy to the modem school; it is indispensable to an accomplished pianist, and every well-educated musician will delight in it; but they err who suppose that in Clementi and Cramer and Dussek and Pleyel, there is nothing good or worth being saved. The fact is, the pianists, previous to him who is generally regarded as the head of the great modern school, had worked out a very satisfactory solution of the problem of piano forte playing, or certainly so if considered with reference to the more natural and legitimate powers of the instrument. Thaiberg, Listz, and others, have certainly much enlarged the boundaries, or the available capacities of the piano, but some of their followers have gone to extremes; so much so that there has seemed to be danger of losing altogether the ordinary effects of piano forte playing, or that they would he swallowed up in the extraordinary feats of left-hand melodies, flights of octaves, and the various methods by which amazement and wonder are excited. Thanks for the signs of returning soberness and good sense; we greatly mistake if other authors like Dussek are not yet to be brought back to the concert room, and to the parlor, to fill with delight the spirit of the true lover of music, and of the most beautiful of all keyed instruments, the piano forte.
A word to another class. There are some who condemn altogether the modern school, and who seem to suppose that all true musical genius left the world with Haydn and those of his day. Fraulein Wieck is not of their number, for while she played Dussek, in the first part of the concert, she played not Thalberg, or Listz, or DeMeyer in the second part, but Pagannini! Yes, the Carnival of Venice, arranged for the piano, and if music pleased legitimately in Dussek, the Fraulein excited no small degree of feeling by her exquisite touch, and facility of execution in the composition of the Prince of violinists. What if it be mere trickery; a dexterous artifice will always, at least, call forth admiration, and one does not always want to sit in sober judgment; and decide on the grounds of intrinsic musical merit — relaxation must be indulged, the beautiful give way to the ornamental, and true pleasure to mere amusement. If there is a time for all things, surely there is room enough for the old and new school of piano forte playing — yes, and for both schools of organ playing too, although this is not the place to dwell upon the latter.
There was still another interesting feature in the Euterpe&nbsp;Concert — it was the singing of Mdlle. Louise Wolfl. She sang an air from Stradella by Flotow, and also two German songs, the latter by Franz Schubert. A pretty singer, but not superior to several American vocalists.",1852-01-Mm,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leipzig,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/509c69b90b2c2274a081cbc51c649d5d/1448276819945,Public Accompanied Indoor,http://musicbrainz.org/artist/f422b99a-b48c-4bee-bc0c-f2e8cad82b6c#_,Dr. Lowell Mason Lowell Mason,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Overture

This, however, he does not do — or did&nbsp;not when I was privileged to meet and hear him — and there are but few pianists living who combine the physical strength, manual skill, and intellectual quickness&nbsp;that may enable a performer hors ligne to overcome the&nbsp;formidable difficulties with which the works above&nbsp;alluded to teem. To sum up Brahms 'pianofort' playing&nbsp;in a few words, it belongs neither to the old nor to the&nbsp;new school; it is not coldly classical, nor ardently emotional; it lacks some of the qualities that constitute&nbsp;executant greatness of the first order; but it is original,&nbsp;and instinct with a genius that is reproductive as well as&nbsp;creative.&nbsp;",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Berlin,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/a77a53c0eade7f4bce6feb12258636d9/1449135808777,Indoor,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/William+Beatty-Kingston/1444079044346,William Beatty-Kingston,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Piano,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_music

A fearful amount of time is spent on railroad trains while jogging from town to town in our country of great distances. &nbsp;&nbsp;[…]In such circumstances, if someone comes along who at once shortens the hours and sweetens the life,—even to the limited extent of making one forget the worst part of it,—that person is a very welcome companion.&nbsp; Just such a desirable person entered our car one dull, rainy day on the New York Central Railroad,—a very attractive lady lecturer and a marvellously fine story-teller.
[…]She had been engaged to lecture in a rather small town in Northern Illinois, and it was her first visit to that section of country. On account of some misunderstanding as to the hour of arrival, there was no committee-man, with welcoming face, to meet her. Finding no one to meet her, and knowing the name of the hotel where she was to stop, Miss A. was the first one to enter its waiting ’bus, and, taking one of the seats farthest from the door, she awaited further developments. In a few minutes two ladies entered, who eyed her wonderingly and exchanged glances and remarks in a way that was not sweetly comforting—soon interrupted, however, by the entrance of several men with musical instruments. The newcomers also looked questioningly at Miss A., but business was evidently on hand, for they began to take out their instruments from bags and cases. Miss A. also noticed that a man spread a cover of fringed white cloth over each horse, bearing some legend which she could not make out, and ornamented with designs of an artistic nature at the corners, groups of banjos, mandolins, fiddles, triangles, flutes, castanets, etc Then the men opened the windows in the 'bus, and “ the band began to play.”
Just imagine the young lady lecturer shrinking into her comer, the stunning noise of ten or twelve brass instruments, reinforced by a big bass drum on the roof of the stage, every blow on which seemed to strike her on the top of her head, and also to act on the honest, staid horses like a bunch of exploding firecrackers tied to their tails. Away they flew and almost brought about the crack of doom to the 'bus and its occupants. The bandmen, however, taught by previous experiences, perceived &nbsp;that a fifty measures’ rest would be a good thing just then, and stopped playing until the horses quieted down. After a while they began again, and as the man on top thumped mezzo forte this time the horses seemed only to be rejuvenated by the sweet sounds and behaved decorously.
The cortege went pretty much all over town, and finally halted at the hotel. The bandmen and the two ladies got out of the ’bus. Miss A., summoning up all the life that was left in her, and separating herself from the crowd, got out with all becoming dignity.

One experience is worth relating. I had a letter of introduction to Mr. X., a great man of the period, the publisher and editor of the principal Washington newspaper. Calling to see him on the day of the first of our two concerts in the old Willard Hall, I was courteously received, and after I had explained the motive of my call, I expressed the hope that he would send a reporter to the concert that evening so as to have a detailed report in the next morning’s paper, and thus help us to a full house on the second night. The good old gentleman replied that his daughter was the only person whom he could trust to write musical notices for his paper. She was not in very good health, but if she could not attend the concert he would have something written up for the morning’s issue without fail.
The concert attracted a fair attendance, and gave evident pleasure. In next morning’s paper we found the “ something without fail ” in the shape of a glowing article; but,—mirabile dictu!—we were all singers instead of players!—a kind of Hutchinson-family arrangement ; that being the sort of music then most enjoyed by the public.
The notice in question contained ecstatic praise of the soprano, and also of the sympathetic alto, declaring that so good a voice had never before been heard in Washington. The tenor “ had the true timbre of a tenor voice,” —there was no suspicion there of a light baritone. The bass was “ a really organ-like support for the beautiful musical superstructure.” The concert was quite an ideal one, etc.
These are not the exact words, perhaps, but they are the substance of the notice, which I now have, filed away in my treasury of funny happenings.",1859-uu-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Washington_(state),http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/ef1e723babd6f32ca6330d62e78d5837/1450278671430,Public Indoor Accompanied,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Thomas+Ryan/1448997315048,Thomas Ryan,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chamber_orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_music

At the close of the second stanza, the organist, continuing to play, changed gradually his key to A minor, closing an intermediate voluntary of about three minutes, diminishing to pianissimo so as to hush the house to perfect silence; then, after a moment’s pause, the people joined again to the lead of the organ, in the fine old choral beginning as follows: e, a g, f e, d—, e—, &amp;c. Four stanzas were sung of three minutes each. Here, then, were two hymns sung in connection; which, with the organ prelude and interlude occupied full half-an-hour in the performance. Men’s voices predominated, marking in strength the bold outlines of the tune; while female voices were heard and seemed to come in echoing, enriching, beautifying, and rendering that charming and lovely which otherwise would have been too severely grand and majestic. The organ was firm and steady, leading along the whole combined chorus with the utmost certainty, and giving full confidence to all the voices.",1852-06-Mm,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/903abef550436101fa3a767ecc89ed4f,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/fd2103c5aafc6f1b03fd1d0da97bfcf2/1448360496695,Indoor Public Accompanied,http://musicbrainz.org/artist/f422b99a-b48c-4bee-bc0c-f2e8cad82b6c#_,Dr. Lowell Mason Lowell Mason,Performance,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/thing/congregation http://dbpedia.org/resource/Female_vocals http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pipe_organ http://dbpedia.org/resource/Male_vocals,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hymn http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chorale

In the evening I attended one of the numerous concerts given in the charming gardens which are to be found in the environs of Hamburg. We had a performance by three military bands, numbering 120 players; they played separately and unitedly, the balance of tone being in both instances remarkably even and good. Amongst other pieces Wagner’s well-known March in Tannhaiiser was played by the united bands, where, at the passage of quavers in the bass towards the end of the composition, the combined brass instruments produced a stupendous effect. Individually, too, these bands executed both classical and popular music with a care, earnestness, and spirit which showed how much personal artistic interest the different performers took in the delightful work they had in hand.

Teresa [Carrefio ]* made her first appearance in Boston, January 4, 1863. She remained here about one month, and was a great attraction at the grand orchestral concerts which were given at that period under the direction of Carl Zerrahn or P. S. Gilmore. She created a furore of enthusiasm every time she played. I doubt if any child pianist of the same age has ever exceeded her in ability. Imagine a child of nine years playing Thalberg’s Moses, Gottschalk’s Jerusalem, and similar pieces, full of technical difficulties.

Far more interesting in its way, although still not directly connected with the subject, was the appearance of the Queen in the theatre on the 31st May, being the evening after an insane attempt upon her life. The visit of Her Majesty had been expected. The opera house was filled in every part to overflowing; and on the entrance of the Queen the expression of enthusiasm was electrical. The whole audience rose to its feet, and one loud deep burst of congratulatory applause burst forth from the vast concourse of human beings. Hats and handkerchiefs were waved. Many ladies sobbed aloud. During this demonstration the Queen stood at the front of her box and curtsied repeatedly, while Prince Albert bowed in reply to the deafening congratulations. The audience would not allow the opera to proceed till the ""National Anthem"" had been sung, and, as a mark of especial respect, Lablache and Persiani joined the rest of the company. At the words ""Scatter her enemies,"" in particular, the most deafening acclama- tions arose, and one cheer more was raised when Her Majesty resumed her seat in the corner of the box. 
On this memorable evening, Mercadante's opera, ""Elena Uberti"" was performed for the first time in Italian, an English version, entitled ""Elena di Feltre,"" having been produced some time back at Covent Garden Theatre, during the engagement of Miss Adelaide Kemble.

Thousands around me were leading dull lives of monotonous toil, with little refreshment or variety, too much shut up to ihe beer-house or the counter, tempted by want and gin, tempted also to all kinds of chicanery and petty theft, and full of sordid aims. I deter- mined to try the effect of music, and good music, upon their narrow, busy, overburdened lives. I invited Mr. C. H. DEACON, SIGNOR REGONDI incomparable on the guitar and concertina and SIGNOR PEZZE to come down and give a concert in the national school-room. The prices of admission were low - 1d. and 3d. The room was crammed; the music was a little over the people's heads; the respectable element predominated a little too much, as I expected, but the class I aimed at was fairly represented. The audience was hushed, attentive, a little awed, but intensely appreciative. I did not play myself. No one had heard me play there, so no one expected me to play then; and I might have lost my character as general manager and president had I contributed to the programme in a musical capacity. I confess the old war-horse within me began to chafe and paw the ground, impatient for action, when the players got well to work. I seemed to feel that my real place was at their side. I had been too lately weaned, but I kept my feelings to myself. 
I believe in music as I believe in pictures for the masses. It draws people together, oils the wheels of the social system, and very much facilitates the intercourse between a pastor and his flock. Music is better than penny readings or lectures for this purpose, chiefly because penny readings, as a rule, are so badly and stupidly conducted. For one person who can attract attention by his reading or lecturing there are a dozen who can excite interest among the poorer classes by singing and playing; and professional musicians are, as a rule, very kind and liberal in giving their services if only a fit occasion presents itself. &nbsp;",186u-uu-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bethnal_Green,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/657265648a073a2ff84fb6f5f2d1248a/1437737331051,Accompanied Indoor Public,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hugh_Reginald_Haweis,Hugh Reginald Haweis,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Concertina http://dbpedia.org/resource/Piano http://dbpedia.org/resource/Guitar http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cello,

After the second act [of La belle Helene] I repaired, by appointment, to the house of Herr Reinecke, with whom, and another musical friend, I spent a most delightful evening.
Here, again, music was all in all; for four hours we were entirely absorbed in it: now one plays the piano, then another ; now a duet, then an improvisation ; now a new original work, then an examination of some novelties by other composers; now a discussion on the state music of England, then the government support of music in Germany ; now organs and&nbsp; organists.

It is not indeed a new hall, but an old one repaired, painted, and ornamented; it is in the same house where Bach lived, and is the very room where Bach, Hiller and others labored and conducted musical performances. Hauptmann now occupies the same apartments which were formerly occupied by the great Fuguist. The exercises, with the exception of a short address by one of the pupils, were exclusively musical, as follows:
I. Prayer. ""Kommet Lasset uns anbeten"", Hauptmann
II. Motette. ""Der Geist hilft unserer Schwachheit, J.S. Bach
III. Four part-songs:-
1. ""O Thaeler weit, o Hoehen"", Mendelssohn
2. ""O sanfter, suesser Hauch"", Mendelssohn
(The above may be found in the ""Social Glee Book,"" and have been sung in the Boston Musical Conventions.)
3. ""Waldeinsamkeit"", Hauptmann
4. ""Ich stand auf, Berges Hoehen"", Hauptmann
IV. Motette. ""Jauchzet dem Herrn"", Schicht.
The singing was by the choir of the school and church, which consisted of about fifty voices; Soprano and Alto by boys. It was entirely without accompaniment. A grand Pianoforte in the room was only used to announce the pitch before each piece.
[... H]ere is a chorus who stand up and sing Bach’s and other most difficult motets, the most difficult vocal music perhaps ever written, by voices alone, with as much certainty as the sure aim of an experienced marksman.
I think I have never before witnessed such devotion to the work as in these singers. Here is indeed entire self-committal. Every one throws all the powers he has, physical and spiritual, into the performance of the music. Every tone is attacked with a conscious certainty of success; no matter how complicated the rhythm, it is given with an energy and truthfulness that a first-rate violinist can hardly excel. The singers seem to have a perfect command of their vocal organs, and are no less certain of results than is the accomplished pianist when he strikes the keys, or the violinist when he draws the bow. There is an entire absence of that sleepiness, drowsiness, inattention, and foolish levity too often witnessed in our choirs. No looking about, or whispering, or laughing, or silliness; but close attention is ever manifested. I wish I had words to point out that consecration to the work, that deep, heartfelt interest which these choir members seem to possess; so that it might be sought for by our American singers. [...] I have never before heard a vocal chorus so prompt, so energetic, and perfect in time and tune, as on this occasion. The place, too, was holy ground, for all the great musicians have visited that saloon; Bach lived there as his home, and Handel, and Haydn, and Mozart, and Beethoven have been there. A new portrait of Bach (or rather an old one put in perfect order) has been placed at the head of the hall, and opposite to it is a fine bust of Schicht, who, though less known, was a very profound musician, as his works testify. On the whole, I have not attended a more interesting musical performance in Germany.

He possessed to a superlative degree all the qualities which make a singer stand head and shoulders above his contemporaries. The “timbre” of his warm baritone voice was quite beautiful, “simpatico” to the last degree, his technique superb (he had studied with Lamperti of Milan, the greatest professor of singing who ever lived, I suppose), and he had not only a great temperament, but he was a finished musician into the bargain, reading the most difficult music easily at sight, and able to express any and every shade of feeling.

Is it a cloud passing over the sky? There seems to be a shuddering in the branches the light fades upon yonder sunny woodlands the foreground darkens apace. The whole scene is moving, but so slowly that it seems to change like a dissolving view. I see the two figures of Gurnemanz and Parsifal moving through the trees they are lost behind yonder rock. They emerge further off higher up. The air grows very dim; the orchestra peals louder and louder. I lose the two in the deepening twilight. The forest is changing, the land is wild and mountainous. Huge galleries and arcades, rock-hewn, loom through the dim forest; but all is growing dark. I listen to the murmurs of the ""Grail” the ""Spear”, the ""Pain,"" the ""Love and Faith"" motives hollow murmurs, confused, floating out of the depths of lonely caves. Then I have a feeling of void and darkness, and there comes a sighing as of a soul swooning away in a trance, and a vision of waste places and wild caverns; and then through the confused dream I hear the solemn boom of mighty bells, only muffled.

In the meanwhile, one step had already been taken by Mademoiselle Lind, in retractation of her resolution to appear no more upon the boards of a theatre. After considerable discussion between the gentleman with whom the future destiny of the young singer was then under- stood to be linked, and myself — the stipulation that the concerts in which she was to take part, should take place at Exeter Hall and at Exeter Hall alone, was waived; and it was announced in the managerial prospectus that Mademoiselle Lind would sing in six concerts at Her Majesty's Theatre. The first of these ""Grand Classical Performances,"" as they were termed, took place (within two days of the first appearance of Mademoiselle Parodi) on Thursday, the 15th April. The concert consisted of a ""recital,"" as it would be called in modern musical phraseology, of Mozart's opera of ""Il Flauto Magico"" in its entirety, in the ordinary concert form, without ""scenery, dresses, or decorations."" 
The result of this experiment was a perfect failure. Could it have been otherwise? Any device to treat a lyrical drama as if it were not a drama, or, in other words, to cheat a theatrical representation of its necessary appliances, so as to evade the ""stage,"" could be nothing but a failure. The great masterpiece of Mozart without the essential accessories of scenery and action, without the illustrative resources which the composer himself contemplated, was simply rendered dreary and incomprehensible. Where was the well-known ""Jenny Lind"" crush? The house was comparatively empty. Where was the customary enthusiasm amounting to a mania? The applause was cold and feeble. The singer, who had been accustomed to hear those same walls ring with plaudits, could not but feel chilled at the faint and rare echoes of that night, so different from the noisy demonstrations of the previous year. The ""Flauto Magico"" was accordingly the first and last of these disappointing ""grand classical performances,"" permission for which had been with so much difficulty wrung from Mademoiselle Lind.",http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/day/1849-04-15,,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/29ca5175ab5beca7c039828a36008a34/1438770967504,Public Accompanied Indoor,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Benjamin+Lumley/1438607277398,Benjamin Lumley,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Recital

The Comasque peasantry scarcely know any food but their polenta, and such fruits as the mountains afford; but though habitually temperate from necessity, they commit excesses, whenever the opportunity offers. The Comasques, poor, laborious, and devout as they are, have several periods of festivity and recreation: their Sundays are always celebrated on the lake, where long after the fall of evening, and the darkening of the waters by the mountain shadows, they continue to row their little boats, or permit them to float, while they execute choruses of mountain music, frequently sung in parts with a science and counterpoint that are purely intuitive. Even the little children sing in bands their airs, with second and bass; and several of the Barcaiuoli (the poets of the lake) assured us that the poetry was equal to the music.",18Ee-uu-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Como,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/132f7471dc17e3af245a0d135ca9998a/1515699584925,Public Outdoor,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Lady+Sydney+Morgan/1515698191138,Lady Sydney Morgan,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Folk_music

The other representation (Her Majesty's Theatre, May 19, 1877) is fraught with sad memories and undying admiration for a courageous woman and a true artist. It had been known for some time that Theresa Tietjens was suffering from cancer; and, after much hesitation, the doctors decided to perform an operation before the end of May. “Lucrezia"" was announced for the 19th, and among the prima donna's friends it was pretty well understood that this would be her last appearance before the operation was performed. 
&nbsp;
When the day arrived Tietjens was far too ill to be really fit to sing. It was distinctly against her medical advisers' wish that she insisted upon keeping faith with her manager and the public— a practice that she had persistently adhered to throughout her career. How she contrived to get through the opera I shall never understand. It can only be compared to some splendid example of martyrdom. She fainted after each of the acts, but immediately on recovering consciousness decided to proceed with the performance. Never so much as a look or gesture betrayed to her audience the mortal anguish she was suffering. Only the initiated knew how much of reality there was in the terrible scream of agony uttered by Lucrezia in the final scene—when she perceives that her son is dead. As it rang through the house the audience shuddered. Yet the brave artist would not shirk her fall at the end. What it cost her could be guessed, however, from the fact that after the curtain had been twice raised in response to rapturous plaudits, she still lay motionless upon the ground. She had once more become insensible. 
In the following week the operation was performed, but the case was hopeless, and on October 3, 1877, Theresa Tietjens breathed her last. She was laid to rest at Kensal Green Cemetery, in the presence of a vast crowd, amid tokens of public grief such as no foreign artist before her had ever been vouchsafed on English soil.",http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/day/1877-05-19,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Her_Majesty's_Theatre,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/b7b7e27a5114822ecabff6da4a1a39fc/1438162240238,Accompanied Indoor Public,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Hermann+Klein/1438157240872,Hermann Klein,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

The concert opened with an overture which is a great favorite here, and often played in public, though I have not heard it in America,— “Iphigene in Aulis,” by Gluck. It is a charming overture, and any one’s musical reputation might safely rest on the production of a single piece like this. Its subjects are at once natural and beautiful, and they are always treated in a most masterly manner; with elaborateness it is always intelligible, and with copiousness it is never diffuse. There is no departing from the main topic of discourse, no wandering in the mazes of thick darkness, or searching for ideas, but the leading thoughts are kept ever before the mind, presented now in this form, and now in that. Its analogies are perfect, its contrasts are striking, and its light and shade are applied with the hand of a Raphael or a Turner. It is full of pleasing melody, yet always subject to the laws of good taste, and manifesting both genius and science; it is in the performance, perhaps, equally satisfactory both to the musician and to the mere unstudied lover of song.
The second piece was an extract (first and second movements) of Cherubini’s Requiem, written for male voices. This, which is one of Cherubini’s great works, was written under circumstances somewhat exciting, as I remember to have heard years ago. On some funeral occasion when a Requiem was desired, that which he had previously written was rejected, because composed for a mixed choir; this caused him to put forth his energies, in the production of a mass for men’s voices only. The music throughout is of a very high character, though it would not much interest those who desire musical gratification only from pretty tunes or pleasant voices. The first movement, “Requiem aeternam” with its accompaniment of violoncellos and double basses, is plaintive and sad, and tells only of sorrow, penitence and grief. In the “Dies irae,” the full powers of the orchestra are brought into requisition; and uniting, as was the case on the present occasion, with sixty well-trained and fearless men’s voices, the effect was awfully grand and commanding. The majestic movements, the severely dissonant harmonies, the wailings of the strings, the frightful appeals of the instruments of blast and percussion, and the cryings out of the voices, all combined to produce an effect which was, at times, truly terrific and overwhelming. The nineteen stanzas, however, have furnished an opportunity for musical contrasts which have been well introduced, affording variety and relief.
The third piece was the very unique but, to the musician, highly interesting ""Concert fur 2 claviere (c moll) Von J. S. Bach."" Following the Requiem, it was like a delightful calm after a storm, enabling one to realize where he was, to breathe easily again, and put on a cheerful countenance.
Several part-songs were then sung by the “Mannerchor” without accompaniment.
The second part consisted of the “Sinfonie in C minor, by L. Von Beethoven” What a symphonie this is! We have often heard it, and it is well known in America. We will not attempt a description; we listened with intense interest to the whole of it, hardly daring to breathe in the piano and not having the power to do so in the forte passages. Is it strange then, that, whether “in the body or out of the body” at its close, we should not be able to tell?",1852-03-12TLl:ll:ll,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leipzig,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/11b1b320ea4311be9893239276f35623/1448281861690,Accompanied Indoor Public,http://musicbrainz.org/artist/f422b99a-b48c-4bee-bc0c-f2e8cad82b6c#_,Dr. Lowell Mason Lowell Mason,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Concerto

On Saturday the 11th March, then, the season of 1843 opened — and opened brilliantly, in spite of the questionable choice of the opera of the night. The ""Adelia"" of Donizetti had been selected for the reappearance of Persiani and the debut of Conti. ""Adelia"" had never been accounted one of the most esteemed operas of the prolific composer, even in Italy. With the anti-Donizetti feeling strong in England (the bigoted lovers of the old school having just then no one else to abuse, in default of the Verdi, who was yet to come), the choice; was, as all must admit, hazardous. The opera, in a musical point of view, was not a success; although the remarkable execution of Persiani, who was enabled to show all her grace and flexibility in a rondo at the conclusion, ""brought down the curtain"" with applause; Conti was received as a steady, zealous, and even energetic tenor, but failed to excite any marked enthusiasm, or to realise the high expectations of the public.",http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/day/1843-03-11,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Her_Majesty's_Theatre,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/8c4fa000d5ee265c764d9e47d23bd03c/1438612692312,Accompanied Indoor Public,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Benjamin+Lumley/1438607277398,Benjamin Lumley,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

The next great event, and one which brought my first season through all its difficulties and dangers to a successful conclusion, was the reappearance of the great tenor Rubini, He was announced for a limited number of nights only, previous to his final retirement from the stage. The intense desire to hear the last notes of this long-established favorite of the frequenters of the opera, brought crowded houses, during every one of his performances, which commenced on the 13th of June, until the end of the season. In the ""Sonnambula,"" in ""Don Giovanni,"" in the ""Puritani,"" in the ""Matri- monio Segreto,"" in ""Anna Bolena,"" in ""Otello,"" in ""Cosi Fan Tutti,"" and in his favourite air from the ""Pirata"" (given on the nights when he did not appear in a whole opera), sung with an embroidery as delicate as Mechlin lace — in all these parts he was listened to with rapture, up to his final farewell.

Will Boston, or at least its Jubilee participators, ever forget the sensation it had when the one hundred firemen—each in his belt, helmet, and red flannel shirt, carrying a long-handled blacksmith’s hammer at “ right shoulder shift ” like a musket—marched into the hall and on to the stage in two files of fifty, and then separated far enough to form a red frame for two sides of the orchestra, which meanwhile was playing the introduction to the “Anvil Chorus ” ? Reaching their special, real anvils, the firemen faced the audience, lifted their hammers to the proper position, and at the right musical moment played and sang the melody.
If ever “the welkin rang” it did then !
In addition to the sounds from a hundred anvils there was the great organ, military band, drum corps, all the bells in the city achime, and a cannon accompaniment. This last came from two batteries of well served guns stationed at a short distance from the building, and a gun was fired off by electricity on the first beat of each measure. A small table was placed on the stage, close to the director, with a set of electric buttons, each having a wire leading to a gun. Mr. John Mullaly was the artist who pressed the button; the gun did the rest. These guns were similarly used for all national airs.
At the termination of the “Anvil Chorus ” there was enormous applause. The whole mass of people rose to their feet, jumped up and down, and nearly dislocated their arms by waving handkerchiefs, fans, hats, parasols, even babies. I am sure that I was never in any great assembly where such wild, almost frantic cheering and applause was heard. Fifty thousand people in a wooden building can make some noise.
The dear, wonderful old maestro, Verdi, did certainly furnish a great opportunity for P. S. Gilmore. It is equally certain that Verdi never dreamed of the possibilities contained in the “ of time began to pound the anvils,—right, left, right, left,— while the great orchestra and chorus slam-bang ” popular melody. When the piece was ended, the gentlemen firemen would march out; and, the applause continuing, they would march back again and go through the whole exciting performance once more.",180u-Ll-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boston,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/8c9fe37be8432ad74bed2aeb6c99c7e6/1450281177648,Indoor Public Accompanied,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Thomas+Ryan/1448997315048,Thomas Ryan,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Drum http://dbpedia.org/resource/Military_band http://dbpedia.org/resource/Organ_(music),http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

Mackenzie was less lucky in his second attempt. Again he had the misfortune to be hampered by one of Dr. Hueffer's elephantine librettos. Hence “The Troubadour” with its ghastly climax, wherein the erring heroine is compelled by her husband to drink a goblet filled with the blood of the fascinating Guillem de Cabestanh, proved too much for even those who admired the melodic charm and dramatic power of the music.

The great painter [Sir John E. Millais] was devoted to music; in fact to be a musician was to be certain of his sympathy. On more than one occasion he said to me, “I love the profession.” He happened to be at St. James’s Hall the night that Mrs. Hutchinson introduced four songs of mine - settings from Tennyson’s “In Memoriam” at a Monday Pop. She sang them beautifully, with great tenderness and feeling, and she looked so charming into the bargain (“ce qui n’a jamais gâté rien”) that it is no wonder she made a success of them. We had studied them carefully together, and I accompanied her that night. How grateful one feels to the really unselfish singer who enters heart and soul into the spirit of one’s composition, and how much one owes them! I am sure I owed the pleasure of knowing Sir John Millais in a great measure to the touching way Mrs. Hutchinson sang “’Tis better to have loved and lost,” for he liked it so much that he asked someone to introduce me to him shortly afterwards.",18Ll-uu-uu,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/3b962f54bdc7412b74ef8c5a33f2c358,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/4037c33141a06afdc104ab417d3bf2d5/1450872493243,Accompanied Public Indoor,http://musicbrainz.org/artist/eca4d562-1e5c-409a-89fa-5489d102cdcb#_,Maude V.

When in the mood he would tell us how, as a youth, he had been taken to St. Andrew's Hall to hear the great Paganini. With an air of awe he would describe the weird aspect and lean, lank form of the illustrious fiddler, as he stood upon the platform in his closely buttoned swallow-tailed coat, playing amid a silence so intense that his auditors almost feared lest their breathing might break the spell.
'Never before or since,' my teacher would say, ‘have I seen an audience wrought to such a pitch of excitement. It was partly the influence of the individual himself, no doubt; but it was also due to the strangely wonderful beauty of the tone that he obtained from his instrument, and the fascination of a method which completely concealed the nature of the difficulties he surmounted.

I remember perfectly well falling into a kind of dream as I leant over the painted iron balcony and looked down on this splendid vista. The silverbell-like tones of an Erard it was the 1000 guinea piano pierced through the human hum, and noise of splashing waters, but it was a long way off. Suddenly, in the adjoining gallery, the large organ broke out with a blare of trumpets that thrilled and riveted me with an inconceivable emotion. I knew not then what those opening bars were. Evidently something martial, festal, jubilant, and full of triumph. I listened and held my breath to hear MENDELSSOHN'S ""Wedding March"" for the first time, and not know it! To hear it when half the people present had never heard of MENDELSSOHN, three years after his death, and when not one in a hundred could have told me what was being played that is an experience I shall never forget. As successive waves of fresh inexhaustible inspiration flowed on, vibrating through the building without a check or a pause, the peculiar Mendelssohnian spaces of cantabile melody alternating as they do in that march with the passionate and almost fierce decision of the chief processional theme, I stood riveted, bathed in the sound as in an element. I felt ready to melt into those harmonious yet turbulent waves and float away upon the tides of ""Music's golden sea setting towards Eternity."" The angel of TENNYSON'S Vision might have stood by me whispering, ‘And thou listenest the lordly music flowing from the illimitable years’. Someone called me, so I was told afterwards, but I did not hear. They supposed that I was following, they went on, and were soon lost in the crowd. Presently one came back and touched me, but I did not feel. I could not be roused, my soul was living apart from my body. When the music ceased the spell slowly dissolved, and I was led away still half in dreamland. For long years afterwards the ""Wedding March” which is now considered banale and claptrap by the advanced school, affected me strangely.

The performance of the Rheingold will live long in my memory, as the extreme realisation of weird beauty steeped in atmosphere such as may be in some other planet, flushed with sunset or moonrise. This music is like a land of dreams, into which the spirit breaks at times, and, hurrying back a million of years, discovers, on the surface of far-off seas, or dim caverns, the light that has long since gone out for ever. The elemental prelude of deep and slumbrous sound wafts us away from all account of time and space of the present. The vast hall, full of silent human beings, has been touched by the magician's wand. All grows dark, and the dim grey-green depths of the Rhine alone become visible. We strain our eyes into the dimness, and are aware of the deep moving of the Rhine water. The three Rhine daughters grow visible, swimming midwater, swimming and singing, guardians of the Rheingold. What unearthly, unhuman, magical, snatches of sweetest song! There is at last realized the creature of legend, the Undine at once more and less than human.",1876-08-uu,,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/2624d0db0f2e567a831f2bd5440388ee/1437993380422,Accompanied Public Outdoor,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hugh_Reginald_Haweis,Hugh Reginald Haweis,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

Hellmesberger was already enthroned; but as soon as he caught sight of me he jumped up, evidently in a great state of excitement, grasped both my hands, and exclaimed — ""How fortunate that thou shouldst have visited us to-day ! Now I will show thee what these children can do. The full score of the “Meistersinger ' has just reached us, and I am now going to take them a prima vista through the overture."" &nbsp;So saying, he gave the accustomed three quick, smart raps, and a breathless silence succeeded the clamour of tuning and chatter that had hitherto prevailed […].To say that I was surprised at the general correctness, vigour, and fire with which this heterogeneous gathering of lads and lasses interpreted one of the most laborious and intricate orchestral compositions in existence, is to describe very inadequately the sensations I experienced upon listening to the "" Meistersinger "" Overture, played at sight by the students of the Vienna Conservatorium. That the rendering was somewhat coarse and rough, shaky as to time here and there, and lacking in light and shade throughout, I do not contest. But not a single break- down occurred, nor was the orchestra pulled up once by its conductor; whose face was radiant with pride and pleasure when he laid down his baton at the conclusion of the Vorspiel. All he said was ""Kinder, es war gar nicht so schlecht!"" (Children, it was really not so bad) ; upon which the “ children "" set up a cheering and clapping of hands that obviously afforded their gifted instructor the liveliest gratification.",1868-Mm-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vienna,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/4b00b3b8552dcb1d1d4e70dc53db1f5c/1444162735045,Indoor Accompanied Domestic,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/William+Beatty-Kingston/1444079044346,William Beatty-Kingston,Performance,,

The theatre opened on Saturday, the 19th February, with Verdi's opera of ""Ernani,"" which had been selected as a favourable framework for the debuts of no less than three new artists — viz., Mademoiselle Cruvelli as Elvira, Signer Cuzzani as Ernani, Signor Beletti as Silva. 
Although Sophie Cruvelli, at this stage of her career, may not have been a faultless vocalist — (and it has been already seen how Rubini had declared, ""Give her good models to study, and a good master, and she mil be great"") — she came, nevertheless, before the London audience with so many natural advantages that she was at once acknowledged as certain to become a general favourite. Indeed, it may be fairly assumed that, had not Jenny Lind so completely absorbed the public mind and thus rendered any rivalry in public estimation almost impossible, Sophie Cruvelli would have exercised even greater sway over the operatic world of London. She was endowed with rare and precious gifts — a magnificent organ, sufficient artistic capacity, and a highly attractive person. She possessed, too, a certain quality which might become a treasure or a bane, according to the way in which she applied it. This was an impulsive, ardent, almost reckless genius — a quality capable of achieving great results, but requiring to be reined in by judgment, taste, and tact, so as not to overspring the boundaries of legitimate art, or (in common parlance) to ""run wild."" Had she the tact, the taste, the judgment? Upon these depended her future greatness. There is no doubt, however, that in spite of the sudden and awful nervousness which fell upon her when for the first time she faced the densely-crowded audience of Her Majesty's Theatre, the aspect of which somewhat paralysed her efforts in her aria entrata, Sophie Cruvelli did achieve a signal success on the occasion of her debut. When once the undeniable spirit within was aroused, she carried all before her by its power. She was young, handsome, impulsive, clever; and with these advantages, she could hardly fail to be irresistible. 
By the side of this strangely-gifted child of genius, another debutante already mentioned obtained a success equally certain, perhaps even more solid. Steady and sound as a musician, Beletti seemed to place his feet upon the boards of the opera-house with a consciousness that it was firm ground. He had a sonorous and flexible voice, sang in a careful, correct style, with a voluble delivery, but was endowed with little power as an actor. Beletti took up his position from the very first evening of his appearance — a position incontestable and uncontested. This was a pleasing circumstance for her who had in some measure staked her own reputation for judgment on the success of her estimable comrade. 
Cuzzani, the favourite of the Berliners, was less happy in his debut. He was pronounced to be “pleasant,"" ""nice,"" or any other epithet that did not go beyond a certain succes d'estime. He appeared under the disadvantage of an influenza; but the judgment of the public was never wholly reversed, either on subsequent evenings or in other operas. 
So great had been the popularity of Gardoni during the previous season, that to produce their pet sympathetic tenor before the habitues of Her Majesty's Theatre, was ever to ""play a trump card."" On this account the young singer was ""cast"" for the character of the king in ""Ernani”; the part in the original score being written for a baritone. Some of the music was consequently transposed for Gardoni. But the commanding power of voice required to enable him to predominate in the great finale of the third act, was wanting ; and accordingly the reputation of the favourite tenor nowise gained by this venture. Still, by dint of all the varied interest due to the novelty of the ""cast,"" ""Ernani"" worked its way, and gave a very important prestige to the opening of Her Majesty's Theatre for the season of 1848.",http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/day/1848-02-19,,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/4977c32be8e2d1f3355faa2b8dda4fbd/1438707471178,Indoor Accompanied Public,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Benjamin+Lumley/1438607277398,Benjamin Lumley,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

On Tuesday the 12th of March, ""I Lombardi,"" another opera by Signor Verdi, was given for the first time, with the names of Grisi, Mario, and Fornasari, and was illustrated by scenery and dresses, which at this period were considered unsurpassed. Here was again a success- nay, a great and noisy success — but yet a doubtful one. After the comparative unanimity with which ""Nabucco"" had been received, it seemed necessary for the forces of the opposition to recommence the attack against a school which now threatened to make its way with the town. Party spirit on the subject was again rife. Whilst, by the Anti-Verdians, ""I Lombardi"" was declared to be flimsy, trashy, worthless ; the Verdi party, and the adherents of the modern Italian school, pronounced it to be full of power, vigour, and originality. The one portion asserted that it was utterly devoid of melody — the other, that it was replete with melody of the most charming kind; the one again insisted that it was the worst work of the aspirant — the other, that it was the young composer's chef-d'oeuvre. And in the midst of this conflict — so analogous to the old feud between the partizans of Gluck and Piccini — public opinion, as usual, seemed undecided and wavering, uttering its old formula of ""Well! I don't know!"" The music, too, was weighed down by a rambling, ill-constructed, uninteresting libretto ; and it is really difficult, under such conditions, to sunder the merit of the musical ""setting"" from the demerit of the text. ""I Lombardi,"" however, was played frequently, and even to crowded houses.",http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/day/1846-03-12,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Her_Majesty's_Theatre,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/52aee68fdb2992dd44cf56724b827960/1438685589068,Public Accompanied Indoor,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Benjamin+Lumley/1438607277398,Benjamin Lumley,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

It is not indeed a new hall, but an old one repaired, painted, and ornamented; it is in the same house where Bach lived, and is the very room where Bach, Hiller and others labored and conducted musical performances. Hauptmann now occupies the same apartments which were formerly occupied by the great Fuguist. The exercises, with the exception of a short address by one of the pupils, were exclusively musical, as follows:
I. Prayer. ""Kommet Lasset uns anbeten"", Hauptmann
II. Motette. ""Der Geist hilft unserer Schwachheit, J.S. Bach
III. Four part-songs:-
1. ""O Thaeler weit, o Hoehen"", Mendelssohn
2. ""O sanfter, suesser Hauch"", Mendelssohn
(The above may be found in the ""Social Glee Book,"" and have been sung in the Boston Musical Conventions.)
3. ""Waldeinsamkeit"", Hauptmann
4. ""Ich stand auf, Berges Hoehen"", Hauptmann
IV. Motette. ""Jauchzet dem Herrn"", Schicht.
The singing was by the choir of the school and church, which consisted of about fifty voices; Soprano and Alto by boys. It was entirely without accompaniment. A grand Pianoforte in the room was only used to announce the pitch before each piece.
[... H]ere is a chorus who stand up and sing Bach’s and other most difficult motets, the most difficult vocal music perhaps ever written, by voices alone, with as much certainty as the sure aim of an experienced marksman.
I think I have never before witnessed such devotion to the work as in these singers. Here is indeed entire self-committal. Every one throws all the powers he has, physical and spiritual, into the performance of the music. Every tone is attacked with a conscious certainty of success; no matter how complicated the rhythm, it is given with an energy and truthfulness that a first-rate violinist can hardly excel. The singers seem to have a perfect command of their vocal organs, and are no less certain of results than is the accomplished pianist when he strikes the keys, or the violinist when he draws the bow. There is an entire absence of that sleepiness, drowsiness, inattention, and foolish levity too often witnessed in our choirs. No looking about, or whispering, or laughing, or silliness; but close attention is ever manifested. I wish I had words to point out that consecration to the work, that deep, heartfelt interest which these choir members seem to possess; so that it might be sought for by our American singers. [...] I have never before heard a vocal chorus so prompt, so energetic, and perfect in time and tune, as on this occasion. The place, too, was holy ground, for all the great musicians have visited that saloon; Bach lived there as his home, and Handel, and Haydn, and Mozart, and Beethoven have been there. A new portrait of Bach (or rather an old one put in perfect order) has been placed at the head of the hall, and opposite to it is a fine bust of Schicht, who, though less known, was a very profound musician, as his works testify.

To dwell upon the reports of his first appearance at Vienna would be only to repeat what ha&amp; already been said. ""The first note that he played on his Guarnerius,"" writes M. SCHILLING in the Lexique Universel de Musique, ""indeed, from his first step into the room, his reputation was decided in Germany. Acted upon, as by an electric spark, a brilliant halo of glory appeared to invest his whole person, he stood before us like a miraculous apparition in the domain of Art!"" He gave concerts in the capital of Austria on the 13th, I6th, and 18th of April 1828. The greatest players and musicians from all parts flocked to hear him. MAYSEDER, JANSA, SLAWICH, STREBINGER, BOHAI, united in extolling the new prodigy. In a very few days Vienna seemed to be turned upside down no class of people was unmoved by the presence of this extraordinary man. The newspapers were full of verses and articles on PAGANINI. Cravats, coats, gloves, hats, shoes, and even cigar-cases and snuff-boxes everything was now a la Paganini. The fashionable cooks called new dishes by his name; any great stroke at billiards was a coup a la Paganini.",http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/day/1828-04-13,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vienna,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/72c49babe2733d5f3ee11478d445e9b7/1437843337998,Accompanied Public Indoor,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Concert+audience/1437737637011,Concert audience,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Violin,

It is exclusively composed of Prussian&nbsp;officers, and frequents the concerts given during the&nbsp;winter season by a full orchestra of guardsmen, every&nbsp;member of which bears his Prussian Majesty's commission. Shortly after the conclusion of the Franco-German&nbsp;war I attended one of these entertainments at the Guard&nbsp;Artillery Barracks, which are situated in a melancholy&nbsp;district, unpenetrated by any of the frequented thorough-fares that are household words to an habitué of the&nbsp;Northern Kaiserstadt — a sort of debateable land, called ""Am Kupfergraben,"" or ""By the Copper Ditch,""...The particular festivity to which I had the honour of&nbsp;being invited was held in celebration of the twenty-first&nbsp;anniversary of the society's birthday, and was characterised by the utmost jollity and good-fellowship. The first&nbsp;part of the entertainment was altogether musical, and&nbsp;consisted of orchestral and solo performances by members&nbsp;of the Union. The programme opened with an ""occasional"" overture by Kalliwoda, correctly and spiritedly&nbsp;rendered; another of the '' numbers "" was Mendelssohn's&nbsp;Grand Concerto (pianoforte and orchestra) in G minor;&nbsp;and a third was the slow movement of a quaint old&nbsp;concerto by Haydn, redolent of pulvilio, and suggesting,&nbsp;at every bar, bag-wigs, clouded canes, knee-breeches&nbsp;and silk stockings. A Saxon artillerist sang the great&nbsp;tenor song out of Freischütz and a Blue hussar — who&nbsp;figured very creditably in the orchestra amongst the&nbsp;first violins — warbled a sentimental ditty, with cello&nbsp;obbligato by the regimental doctor, to everybody's&nbsp;unbounded gratification.",1871-uu-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Berlin,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/4dd2b9421df32258ae6a33af01fb285f/1451994121567,Accompanied Public Indoor,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/William+Beatty-Kingston/1444079044346,William Beatty-Kingston,Performance,,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_music

The Germania held together about six years —most of the time in Boston. They made many short trips in New England, and one tournde with Jenny Lind. Their summers were profitably spent in Newport In the last two seasons they added as stars the famous girl violinist, Camille Urso, and Alfred Jaell, pianist Madame Urso is too well known to need any eulogy at my hands. She is one of the very few young wonders who developed into great artists at maturity. Jaell was a splendid pianist. If he were playing at the present day, he would bear comparison with the greatest living players. When the Germania disbanded, he went to Paris, made his home in that city, and won a popularity which he never lost. He died very recently.
The Germania were the first to play in Boston the C-Major Symphony of Schubert, the Ninth Symphony by Beethoven, and the Tannhauser overture.",184u-uu-uu,,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/dac13a888622c4e9a92a0712249b0ddf/1450196112316,Indoor Public Accompanied,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Thomas+Ryan/1448997315048,Thomas Ryan,Performance,,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_music

The concert room is not large, but convenient, and good for musical effect. The centre of the room is occupied by ladies, and the outer seats mostly by gentlemen. A narrow gallery, in which are a number of private boxes, runs round the room. The first object of attraction, after entering the room, is a fine large medallion of Mendelssohn, back of the orchestra; there is no other bust or picture in the room. It makes one feel sod when looking at this fine representation of the great modem composer, in the very room where he has been, and still is, so highly appreciated, and where he has so often triumphed gloriously, to think that he was cut off in his youth, and that the musical world, after so short a time of enjoyment, was deprived of the talents and learning of one who promised to do for music, perhaps, more than any man living. At almost every concert, more or less of his music is performed; his memory is cherished, not only here, where he was so well known, but by all the musical world, and his name shall be held in everlasting remembrance.
A crowd of people were waiting round the door, when we arrived; and, although it was an hour before the time for the performance to commence, the room was filled, (save the reserved seats in the gallery,) in a few minutes after the door was opened. One must be on hand at an early hour to get a good seat. In about half an hour the members of the orchestra began to make their appearance, and as all the people in the house were talking loud, so the musicians, as they came in, one after another, began to tune, to try their instruments, and to amuse themselves by running over the scales; so that by the time they were all there, thus employed, the room was filled with sound; the more so because, as the musicians began to exercise themselves upon their instruments, the talking and laughing grew louder and louder, and at a quarter of an hour before the commencement of the music, it was a perfect Babel in the concert room, and as difficult to hear one speak as it is in a railroad car, with all the windows open, in summer. But a few minutes before the hour, the room began to grow quiet, musical expectation began to awaken, and when, as the precise moment arrived, the conductor’s signal was heard, everything was still, and perfect silence took the place of noise and confusion. Another signal, and the whole band, as one man, were heard interpreting and presenting to a most attentive audience, one of the great works of the immortal Beethoven.
It was the Sinfonie No. 8, F major. This is not regarded as one of Beethoven’s greatest triumphs; but, although it is light and playful, it abounds in each of its four movements, with the most fanciful and imaginative melodic figures, contrapuntal points, and instrumental contrasts. Ever lively and ever new, it never tires, but holds one in a kind of musical ecstasy from beginning to end; there seems to be no place where one can relax attention, or cease to be filled with musical delight; so that at the close of each part, a good long breath naturally comes in as a relief; and one becomes conscious of the intensity of the application he has been giving to the discourse.
The very first thing which strikes one, on hearing such an orchestra as this, is the perfect oneness of the violins. They do, indeed, constitute a perfect chorus — ten or more persons are playing the first violin, and as many more the second; but they are all artists, and, therefore, each one loses himself; no one is heard above the others; but all so beautifully blend as to constitute one perfect whole. This is the perfection of a chorus, be it vocal or instrumental; and this effect is produced by the Gewandhaus Orchestra.
Another point, immediately noticed, is the proper proportion of wind and stringed instruments; but perhaps the most striking point, as contrasted with our American orchestras, is the perfection of the wind instruments. It is too often the case in our orchestras that some wind instrument is wanting; thus the oboe or the faggotto is often missing; and again, it is not unfrequently the case that, although there may be some one to hold these or other instruments in the hand, or up to the sight of the audience, a tone is seldom permitted to escape from them; they are seen but not heard, Not so here; every instrument is not only represented to the eye, but is in the hands of a master who makes it speak to the ear. The consequence is, that such combinations fall upon the ear as are not heard with us. The brass instruments too are made to tell their story without any impediment of speech; whereas, with us, they stutter, or falter, or hem, or cough, to the no small disturbance of the equilibrium of one’s temper. We do not know that in this concert every instrument is played in all respects right; we do not know but some notes may have been omitted, or wrong tones produced, but certain are we that we did not discover any such imperfections. There are four things, (technical points,) that we have seldom heard well exhibited elsewhere, which were exceedingly well brought out here, viz.: Piano, Crescendo, Diminuendo and Fortzando. These, with the other technicals of playing were so well observed, that added to the pure tone peculiar to each particular instrument, and connected with a most perfect amalgamation or blending of all the different elements of the orchestra, they seemed to produce, not a mere musical performance to be listened to, but a living being, or moral, spiritual existence, capable of expressing the deepest feeling, and of calling forth the strongest sympathies of humanity.
The Sinfonie being over, and a few moments for rest having been given, old Handel visited us in an Arie from his Opera “Aerio” — “Folle e colui che al tuo favor si fida.” It was sung by Herrn Salvatore Marchesi, who was the only vocalist for the evening. The song was well sung; but we sometimes hear quite as good singing across the Atlantic. Belletti is decidedly his superior. The third piece was a Flute Concerto; it was a tiresome affair. A Flute Concerto is a Flute Concerto, whether in the Gewandhaus, Hanover Square rooms, Tripler Hall or the Melodeon; and although it may not be always played by Herrn W. Haake, (who certainly did his duty well,) it is always the most dry and uninteresting of musical performances.
In part 2d was given, 1st, the beautiful overture Echoes of Ossian, (often played in New York and Boston,) by N. W. Gade. 2d. Arie from Zauberflote, by Mozart, “Qui sdegno non s' accende."" 3d. Mendelssohn’s concerto for the piano forte, in D. Minor. 4th. Arie from Don Giovanni, by Mozart, “Madamina, il catalogo e questo,"" and 5th. The very fine overture to the opera, “Der Wassertrager,” by Cherubini.
Gade’s overture may be regarded as a sacred piece. It speaks of greatness, and calls forth emotions of the sublime. Something like an Old Chorale pervades the whole, which seems to tell of worship, and to call forth humble adoration. With what grandeur this subject was given out, and oft in the course of the piece alluded to by the brass instruments, or exemplified and illustrated by the others, cannot be told. The overture is known with us, but it requires and deserves dose study.
The Piano Forte Concerto, D (not G) Minor, failed for want of a performer; a highly promising young lad of the conservatory attempted it, but he had neither grasp of mind nor of hand enough for Mendelssohn. Herr Marchesi sang both airs well, gaining for himself decided applause.
On the whole, here is a highly-talented and well-regulated orchestra. The conductor for the evening was Julius Rietz, well known to the musical world.
I will mention one or two things about the audience:
1st. Gentlemen took off their hats before passing the door of the hall, all of them, without a single exception; and this, although they were there an hour before the performance commenced. There was not a single man standing under the galleries or near the doors, uncovered. The ungentlemanly act of standing or sitting in a concert room with hats on, could not be seen in the Gewandhaus.
2d. Ladies were all in full dress.
3d. There was silence during the performance of music. The moment the music ceased, then indeed there was a perfect buzzing of voices, and very loud talking all over the room; but at the signal for the commencement of the music, all was still; and we were not prevented from hearing the music by those whisperings, so annoying in some places.
On the whole, this was a very fine concert; the orchestra playing was as near to perfection, I doubt not, as can often be found; and that constitutes the great attraction of the Gewandhaus. Every man seems to be able to play on his own instrument well; every man seems to give undivided attention to the music, and to endeavor to observe carefully, not only the time, as given by the conductor, but all those little gesticulations by which expression is indicated.

It was nearly the same as at the Worcester cathedral. The choir is a little larger, but the same irreverent hurrying prevails. The manner of treating the cadences in the chant I like, for there is no singing, drawling style, but the tones are short and words quickly spoken; but with respect to the chanting in other respects, or in general, it is all confused, inarticulate, rapid and unsatisfactory — still it is not relatively, perhaps, much quicker than the other parts of the service.

There is a curious noise that is often heard towards night-time in a Chilian village. It is seldom indeed that some member of the family does not play the guitar, and often, in the cool of the evening, you will see dusky, half Indian-looking people seated just outside the door of their ranchos with their instruments on their knees. They do not always pluck the strings; sometimes they take the notes of a chord with the left hand while they hit the strings with their closed fingers to the rhythm of the samacueca; the faint chords struggle to make themselves heard, but are almost drowned by the persistent noise made on the lower part of the instrument by another member of the family who beats time with his knuckles.

The following is the translation of a letter which Gounod addressed to Jean de Reszke in 1892 (the year of the composer's&nbsp;death), on the day after the tenor's appearance in the one-hundredth performance of “Romeo"" at the Paris Opera: &nbsp;&nbsp;
My dear Jean: &nbsp;&nbsp;
You literally surpassed yourself last night. Perhaps that surprises you? It does me, too. Nevertheless, it is true. Never&nbsp;have you carried to such a height that beauty of diction and &nbsp;gesture, that correctness and expressiveness of accent, that control of voice production — in a word, that perfectly balanced proportion which alone makes the great artist by placing him beyond &nbsp;the danger of extremes, the perpetual temptation of the incompetent. Thanks and bravo, again and always! May heaven preserve you and leave us your beautiful art as long as possible! &nbsp;Of such as you we have great need. Remember me to dear &nbsp;Edouard, who, like yourself, has the air of having been born in &nbsp;his role, and believe me, both of you, &nbsp;&nbsp;

The emotional dialogue was carried on between the two in a manner which fairly overcame the audience with delight, and led to the GRAND DUCHESS requesting him to try one string alone next time.

To my great surprise, this noted organist politely but firmly insisted upon my trying the qualities of the instrument before he himself displayed them. This unusual proceeding was afterwards explained to me as being his usual plan for testing a man, for finding that his time had been too often wasted upon men whose acquaintance with music and organs was very limited, and who generally mistook enthusiasm for knowledge, the Professor was compelled to adopt some scheme, whereby he might be enabled to judge of his visitors’ musical capabilities. After complying with his request and playing for a short time, the rightful owner of the organist’s seat took his place, and for one hour greatly delighted me with his performance on the instrument. The selection comprised Bach’s grand Prelude and Fugue in B minor ; Louis Thiele’s air and elaborate variations in A flat; some variations of his own on a chorale ; and a short improvisation. The salient features of his playing were more especially exhibited in the Fugue of Bach’s, played as it was with remarkable dignity and grandeur of style—at a speed too, considerably slower than that usually adopted by the majority of modern English organists. Never, indeed, much of Sebastian Bach’s organ music as I have heard played by the most noted English organists, did I enjoy the music of the grand old Leipzig cantor so thoroughly ; never did I hear this stupendous creation of his fertile brain developed with a more masterly appreciation of its varied beauties, subtle harmonies, and erudite counterpoint.

On Tuesday the 17th of March, the ""run"" of ""Nino"" was interrupted, to give a trial to three young artists of some note, and of still greater promise. The opera of ""Ernani"" was selected, to enable Madame Pasini, Signor Castigliano (a pupil of Rubini), and Signor Bencich to appear, as soprano, tenor, and baritone, in the principal characters of that opera. All three failed, Signor Bencich alone being voted tolerable. &nbsp;&nbsp; ",http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/day/1846-03-17,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Her_Majesty's_Theatre,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/4977c32be8e2d1f3355faa2b8dda4fbd/1438684710894,Public Accompanied Indoor,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Benjamin+Lumley/1438607277398,Benjamin Lumley,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

The elements were thus ripe for a fresh triumph &nbsp;when the time came for the production of “I &nbsp;Rantzau'' on July 7. Mascagni's third opera had &nbsp;seen the light at Florence only in the previous &nbsp;November. The book appeared to offer a promising combination, being written by the librettist &nbsp;of “Cavalleria Rusticana” and founded upon a &nbsp;novel, “Les Deux Freres,'' by MM. Erckmann - Chatrian, the authors of “L'Amico Fritz."" Unfortunately, the material of the plot proved altogether inadequate for a four-act opera, while the &nbsp;love interest which so largely predominated in &nbsp;“L'Amico Fritz'' was here subordinated to the &nbsp;events of a sordid quarrel between two wilful, ill-tempered brothers. Moreover, Mascagni treated &nbsp;the quarrel in an intensely tragic vein, which is &nbsp;nowhere more strikingly exemplified than in the &nbsp;long and elaborate finale to the first act. This &nbsp;ambitious piece of writing I have described as &nbsp;strong, rugged, original, and clever. “Nevertheless, a big effort of the imagination is required to &nbsp;suppose an entire village so upset by a squabble &nbsp;over a field as to stand in two sections in the &nbsp;open piazza, shouting at each other for ten minutes by the clock!"" Even a street row in Nuremberg, aroused by a matter of genuine public &nbsp;interest, was depicted by Wagner in less time than &nbsp;that. &nbsp;So, despite the presence and cooperation of the &nbsp;genial young composer, “I Rantzau” was not a &nbsp;success. The principal parts were sung by Melba, &nbsp;De Lucia, Ancona, David Bispham, and Castelmary, and the opera was mounted in thoroughly &nbsp;efficient style.",http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/day/1893-07-07,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Covent_Garden,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/7ee4239bfdca89414139a2b8d31209f8/1438532689450,Indoor Public Accompanied,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Hermann+Klein/1438157240872,Hermann Klein,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

It was a most interesting gathering of nearly eighty singers ; there seemed to be about twenty-four sopranos, twenty altos (all females), sixteen tenors, and sixteen basses. They were conducted by Professor Griel, Herr Blumner presiding at the piano. The programme included : —
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Choral (from a Motet), J.S. Bach
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “ Sancta Maria ”,&nbsp;Hellwig
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Motet, ending with Choral “ Der&nbsp;Hirte Israel”, J.S. Bach
4.Mass,“LobgesangamSchopfung’s&nbsp;Morgen ”, Reichard
The tone of the bass voices was remarkably good and sonorous, the lower notes, even as low as double D, being sung with perfect clearness of intonation ; but the other sections did not appear to me to equal corresponding voices of well trained choirs in our own country. 
The discipline and order, however, of the whole affair cannot be too highly commended to the notice of similar societies at home. Members, as they entered the orchestra, first politely saluted the conductor, then the pianist, and quietly took their allotted seats, where their copies were found arranged in the order of practice. No talking or annoying noises were allowed in any part of the room during the perform­ance of a piece, and the few of the audience who happened to arrive late exhibited that respect, which all Germans seem to entertain, for the art, and showed their indisposition to mar the enjoyment of others by gently and cautiously moving on tip-toe as short a distance as possible. All the choir stood whilst singing, but whenever any part had several bars rest, those, whose voices were not needed sat down, and at a glance of the conductor’s eye, who was always ready to give the signal, rose en masse with military precision just before the commencement of their part.

Before coming to Boston I had played second clarinet in the Dublin (Ireland) Philharmonic Society. In the season of 1844-45, that Society brought out the Scotch Symphony and the Midsummer Night's Dream overture, by Mendelssohn.
[…]
We must remember that fifty years ago there were not many professional musicians of sufficient technical ability to cope with Me-delssohn’s music, which even to-day is classified as difficult. Our orchestra was made up half of amateurs and half of professionals. We could have no lightning-express trains in tempo; most music was played tempo commodo.
[…]
Well, we tried it. Our conductor was Mr. Geo. J. Webb,—an excellent general musician, but who had never heard the overture. He began by telling us that he had no score; so he stood up alongside of the first-violin desk and prepared to conduct. Rapping on the desk, he gave the signal to begin; out piped two flutes,—nothing else. He rapped again, implying that the players had not been ready to begin; then he said, “We will try again.” He gave the signal—and out piped the two flutes. That caused a little titter of surprise, and we all looked quizzically at each other. Mr. Webb, however, dutifully gave the signal for the next “ hold ” or chord, when two clarinets joined the two flutes! More surprise. At the third hold (chord) the fagotti and horns were added, and at the fourth hold (chord) the entire wood and wind instruments, all sounding most distressingly out of tune. This dissonant and unlooked-for result was followed by a dead pause; then every one of the players broke out with a hearty laugh of derision.
I was on pins and needles and muttered, “ Go on, go on! ” After a while the people sobered down, and we tried to commence with the string part The first and second violins (each relative part divided into two parts) began at an “accommodation-train” tempo. At the end of the violin passage, the wood and wind again held a very dissonant chord for two measures, which this time sounded so abominably out of tune that it really was as bad as if each man played any note he pleased ; and it was so irresistibly funny that again everybody burst out laughing. But I buried my head under the music desk and cried ; my idol was derided, every one poked fun at me.
That last dissonant chord ended the first rehearsal of the Midsummer Nights Dream overture. We never tried it again.",180u-Ee-uu,,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/0d92b31f945517ca2e48176d234b29cc/1449605804435,Public Indoor Accompanied,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Thomas+Ryan/1448997315048,Thomas Ryan,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flute http://dbpedia.org/resource/Violin http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horn_(instrument) http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clarinet,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_music

It is not indeed a new hall, but an old one repaired, painted, and ornamented; it is in the same house where Bach lived, and is the very room where Bach, Hiller and others labored and conducted musical performances. Hauptmann now occupies the same apartments which were formerly occupied by the great Fuguist. The exercises, with the exception of a short address by one of the pupils, were exclusively musical, as follows:
I. Prayer. ""Kommet Lasset uns anbeten"", Hauptmann
II. Motette. ""Der Geist hilft unserer Schwachheit, J.S. Bach
III. Four part-songs:-
1. ""O Thaeler weit, o Hoehen"", Mendelssohn
2. ""O sanfter, suesser Hauch"", Mendelssohn
(The above may be found in the ""Social Glee Book,"" and have been sung in the Boston Musical Conventions.)
3. ""Waldeinsamkeit"", Hauptmann
4. ""Ich stand auf, Berges Hoehen"", Hauptmann
IV. Motette. ""Jauchzet dem Herrn"", Schicht.
The singing was by the choir of the school and church, which consisted of about fifty voices; Soprano and Alto by boys. It was entirely without accompaniment. A grand Pianoforte in the room was only used to announce the pitch before each piece.
[... H]ere is a chorus who stand up and sing Bach’s and other most difficult motets, the most difficult vocal music perhaps ever written, by voices alone, with as much certainty as the sure aim of an experienced marksman.
I think I have never before witnessed such devotion to the work as in these singers. Here is indeed entire self-committal. Every one throws all the powers he has, physical and spiritual, into the performance of the music. Every tone is attacked with a conscious certainty of success; no matter how complicated the rhythm, it is given with an energy and truthfulness that a first-rate violinist can hardly excel. The singers seem to have a perfect command of their vocal organs, and are no less certain of results than is the accomplished pianist when he strikes the keys, or the violinist when he draws the bow. There is an entire absence of that sleepiness, drowsiness, inattention, and foolish levity too often witnessed in our choirs. No looking about, or whispering, or laughing, or silliness; but close attention is ever manifested. I wish I had words to point out that consecration to the work, that deep, heartfelt interest which these choir members seem to possess; so that it might be sought for by our American singers. [...] I have never before heard a vocal chorus so prompt, so energetic, and perfect in time and tune, as on this occasion. The place, too, was holy ground, for all the great musicians have visited that saloon; Bach lived there as his home, and Handel, and Haydn, and Mozart, and Beethoven have been there. A new portrait of Bach (or rather an old one put in perfect order) has been placed at the head of the hall, and opposite to it is a fine bust of Schicht, who, though less known, was a very profound musician, as his works testify. On the whole, I have not attended a more interesting musical performance in Germany.

Playing in this new theatre was for me an agreeable change. It had, for those days, quite a sizable orchestra. The leader sat facing the stage, and was for a long time the only first violin. We had but one second violin, one viola, one contrabass, no violoncello, one flute, two clarinets, one fagott, two horns, a trumpet, a trombone, and drums. The kind and quality of music played would nowadays strike one as queer. It consisted of overtures, quadrilles, polkas, galops—in short, mostly dance music. There was a total absence of so-called popular music, if we except a few quicksteps and marches. There were no characteristic pieces such as figure on the programmes of today.
I well remember the first one we were asked to play. It was called the Matrimonial Galop. It was of ordinary construction, the only reason for its peculiar name being a sudden hold-up, where the drummer or leader, I forget which, blew into a little instrument that gave out a sound like the cry of a baby. That childish noise made the audience roar with delight, and we had to play it nightly. We poor musicians suffered ; but one night we had our revenge. The usual calls came from the audience—they wanted the baby-cry, but did not get it The machine crying-baby had vanished— it could not be found. Consternation reigned among those who wanted the people pleased, no matter how it was done. We tried to appease the audience by playing the galop; but when we came to the spot of spots, and there was no realistic baby-cry, but only a base imitation made on the fiddle, a howl of derision and rage went up, equal to anything ever heard in a menagerie. The disappointment was more than the audience could stand.",184u-uu-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boston,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/ab1bfe9cfe9d0a7a5f83197f5ca89828/1449564475544,Indoor Public Accompanied,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Thomas+Ryan/1448997315048,Thomas Ryan,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Violin http://dbpedia.org/resource/Viola http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trumpet http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horn_(instrument) http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cello http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flute http://dbpedia.org/resource/Drum http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trombone http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clarinet,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dance_music

The orchestra was not large, being chiefly composed of young artists, who, I was informed, played more to obtain experience than with a view to pecuniary profit. The heroine was played by a popular actress, Fraulein Hartmann. As a whole the opera was well performed ; but the singing, both solo and choral, was not particularly good. There, as in every similar place in Germany, I noticed the remarkable attention of the audience to every detail of the performance. Between each of the acts one of those polite and handy German waiters, always found in such places, offered refreshment in the shape of a seidel of beer, a small bottle of Rheinwein, German sausages, and Westphalia ham sandwiches.",187u-Mm-uu,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/831dc23cb1b1027c08e80ec2b35b550c,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/ec0a14a20d6dfa66d4c6c028e5f99df0/1469025032757,Public Indoor Accompanied,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Dr+William+Spark/1465384918944,Dr William Spark,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Female_vocals,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

2. “The Singer's Curse.” After M. Tolz. Accompanied by music from Robert Schumann’s third Symphonie.
3. “A Landscape.” A group of young men accompany a comrade on his way out of town, and they all sing “Must I leave thee, Native Town.” His beloved watches from a bower, and after all have disappeared sings a sad song of parting.
4. “Ave Maria.” After Rubens. Accompanied by a “Salve Regina,” composed by M. Hauptmann.
5. “Grand Battle Piece.” “Frederick the Great at the Battle of Prague.” A most splendid tableaux with many figures. Accompanied by a military movement by the orchestra.
6. “Landscape. Review” The muses appear on an eminence; on one side in the foreground is a group of Orpheus; next, the young and old singers from the second picture; then, the young man, and his beloved from the third, the monks from the fourth, and Frederick from the fifth.

This invitation was the result of a strong conviction on the part of Niebuhr of the propriety of making such a demonstration of respect, both to his countrymen and to the grandees of Rome, and to the diplomatic body ; and having once made up his mind to do this, the fete was carried out with grand effect, the locality having the advantage, ever belonging to Roman palaces, of suitable space. A fete of the ordinary kind, either with dancing, or a performance of theatrical music, was felt to be too incongruous with the character and taste of the great historian, to be admissible; moreover, it was wholly unsuited to the serious aspect of a house and family, over which the ill-health of Madame Niebuhr cast a continual shadow. In the difficulty of selection of a means of giving object and character to the invitation of a mixed multitude, Bunsen's original suggestion was gladly accepted by Niebuhr, who obtained the assent of Consalvi in the name of the Pope, while Bunsen negotiated on his part with Baini, the selection of singers and of pieces ; in which last the judgement of Kocher was also consulted : and the Missa Papae Marcelli (an early and comparatively cheerful and popular work of Palestrina), the anthem ' Tu es Petrus' (belonging to the Papal Corona tion service, also by Palestrina), and the grand Dies irae (of Pittoni, somewhat later than Palestrina), were chosen as being most effective. Niebuhr himself was neither musical, nor in general fond of music, but he was as susceptible of grand devotional strains, as he was of the echoes of the weal and woe of human races to be found in national melodies: and so far, like Bunsen, he admired what his philosophical reflection approved.",182u-uu-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rome,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/http://data.open.ac.uk/led/music/Dies+Irae/1373902731886/1433771866942,Indoor Accompanied,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Barthold_Georg_Niebuhr http://dbpedia.org/resource/Christian_Charles_Josias_von_Bunsen http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Prince+Hardenberg/1386076559167 http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Prime+Minister+of+Prussia/1433771572593 http://dbpedia.org/resource/Heinrich_Friedrich_Karl_vom_und_zum_Stein,"Barthold Georg Niebuhr Christian Charles Josias, Baron von Bunsen Baron von Bunsen Christian Karl Josias von Bunsen Christian Charles Josias von Bunsen Prince Hardenberg Prime Minister of Prussia Baron Stein",Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Religious_music http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vocal_music http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chorale

The concert room is not large, but convenient, and good for musical effect. The centre of the room is occupied by ladies, and the outer seats mostly by gentlemen. A narrow gallery, in which are a number of private boxes, runs round the room. The first object of attraction, after entering the room, is a fine large medallion of Mendelssohn, back of the orchestra; there is no other bust or picture in the room. It makes one feel sod when looking at this fine representation of the great modem composer, in the very room where he has been, and still is, so highly appreciated, and where he has so often triumphed gloriously, to think that he was cut off in his youth, and that the musical world, after so short a time of enjoyment, was deprived of the talents and learning of one who promised to do for music, perhaps, more than any man living. At almost every concert, more or less of his music is performed; his memory is cherished, not only here, where he was so well known, but by all the musical world, and his name shall be held in everlasting remembrance.
A crowd of people were waiting round the door, when we arrived; and, although it was an hour before the time for the performance to commence, the room was filled, (save the reserved seats in the gallery,) in a few minutes after the door was opened. One must be on hand at an early hour to get a good seat. In about half an hour the members of the orchestra began to make their appearance, and as all the people in the house were talking loud, so the musicians, as they came in, one after another, began to tune, to try their instruments, and to amuse themselves by running over the scales; so that by the time they were all there, thus employed, the room was filled with sound; the more so because, as the musicians began to exercise themselves upon their instruments, the talking and laughing grew louder and louder, and at a quarter of an hour before the commencement of the music, it was a perfect Babel in the concert room, and as difficult to hear one speak as it is in a railroad car, with all the windows open, in summer. But a few minutes before the hour, the room began to grow quiet, musical expectation began to awaken, and when, as the precise moment arrived, the conductor’s signal was heard, everything was still, and perfect silence took the place of noise and confusion. Another signal, and the whole band, as one man, were heard interpreting and presenting to a most attentive audience, one of the great works of the immortal Beethoven.
It was the Sinfonie No. 8, F major. This is not regarded as one of Beethoven’s greatest triumphs; but, although it is light and playful, it abounds in each of its four movements, with the most fanciful and imaginative melodic figures, contrapuntal points, and instrumental contrasts. Ever lively and ever new, it never tires, but holds one in a kind of musical ecstasy from beginning to end; there seems to be no place where one can relax attention, or cease to be filled with musical delight; so that at the close of each part, a good long breath naturally comes in as a relief; and one becomes conscious of the intensity of the application he has been giving to the discourse.
The very first thing which strikes one, on hearing such an orchestra as this, is the perfect oneness of the violins. They do, indeed, constitute a perfect chorus — ten or more persons are playing the first violin, and as many more the second; but they are all artists, and, therefore, each one loses himself; no one is heard above the others; but all so beautifully blend as to constitute one perfect whole. This is the perfection of a chorus, be it vocal or instrumental; and this effect is produced by the Gewandhaus Orchestra.
Another point, immediately noticed, is the proper proportion of wind and stringed instruments; but perhaps the most striking point, as contrasted with our American orchestras, is the perfection of the wind instruments. It is too often the case in our orchestras that some wind instrument is wanting; thus the oboe or the faggotto is often missing; and again, it is not unfrequently the case that, although there may be some one to hold these or other instruments in the hand, or up to the sight of the audience, a tone is seldom permitted to escape from them; they are seen but not heard, Not so here; every instrument is not only represented to the eye, but is in the hands of a master who makes it speak to the ear. The consequence is, that such combinations fall upon the ear as are not heard with us. The brass instruments too are made to tell their story without any impediment of speech; whereas, with us, they stutter, or falter, or hem, or cough, to the no small disturbance of the equilibrium of one’s temper. We do not know that in this concert every instrument is played in all respects right; we do not know but some notes may have been omitted, or wrong tones produced, but certain are we that we did not discover any such imperfections. There are four things, (technical points,) that we have seldom heard well exhibited elsewhere, which were exceedingly well brought out here, viz.: Piano, Crescendo, Diminuendo and Fortzando. These, with the other technicals of playing were so well observed, that added to the pure tone peculiar to each particular instrument, and connected with a most perfect amalgamation or blending of all the different elements of the orchestra, they seemed to produce, not a mere musical performance to be listened to, but a living being, or moral, spiritual existence, capable of expressing the deepest feeling, and of calling forth the strongest sympathies of humanity.
The Sinfonie being over, and a few moments for rest having been given, old Handel visited us in an Arie from his Opera “Aerio” — “Folle e colui che al tuo favor si fida.” It was sung by Herrn Salvatore Marchesi, who was the only vocalist for the evening. The song was well sung; but we sometimes hear quite as good singing across the Atlantic. Belletti is decidedly his superior. The third piece was a Flute Concerto; it was a tiresome affair. A Flute Concerto is a Flute Concerto, whether in the Gewandhaus, Hanover Square rooms, Tripler Hall or the Melodeon; and although it may not be always played by Herrn W. Haake, (who certainly did his duty well,) it is always the most dry and uninteresting of musical performances.
In part 2d was given, 1st, the beautiful overture Echoes of Ossian, (often played in New York and Boston,) by N. W. Gade. 2d. Arie from Zauberflote, by Mozart, “Qui sdegno non s' accende."" 3d. Mendelssohn’s concerto for the piano forte, in D. Minor. 4th. Arie from Don Giovanni, by Mozart, “Madamina, il catalogo e questo,"" and 5th. The very fine overture to the opera, “Der Wassertrager,” by Cherubini.
Gade’s overture may be regarded as a sacred piece. It speaks of greatness, and calls forth emotions of the sublime. Something like an Old Chorale pervades the whole, which seems to tell of worship, and to call forth humble adoration. With what grandeur this subject was given out, and oft in the course of the piece alluded to by the brass instruments, or exemplified and illustrated by the others, cannot be told. The overture is known with us, but it requires and deserves dose study.
The Piano Forte Concerto, D (not G) Minor, failed for want of a performer; a highly promising young lad of the conservatory attempted it, but he had neither grasp of mind nor of hand enough for Mendelssohn. Herr Marchesi sang both airs well, gaining for himself decided applause.
On the whole, here is a highly-talented and well-regulated orchestra. The conductor for the evening was Julius Rietz, well known to the musical world.
I will mention one or two things about the audience:
1st. Gentlemen took off their hats before passing the door of the hall, all of them, without a single exception; and this, although they were there an hour before the performance commenced. There was not a single man standing under the galleries or near the doors, uncovered. The ungentlemanly act of standing or sitting in a concert room with hats on, could not be seen in the Gewandhaus.
2d. Ladies were all in full dress.
3d. There was silence during the performance of music. The moment the music ceased, then indeed there was a perfect buzzing of voices, and very loud talking all over the room; but at the signal for the commencement of the music, all was still; and we were not prevented from hearing the music by those whisperings, so annoying in some places.
On the whole, this was a very fine concert; the orchestra playing was as near to perfection, I doubt not, as can often be found; and that constitutes the great attraction of the Gewandhaus. Every man seems to be able to play on his own instrument well; every man seems to give undivided attention to the music, and to endeavor to observe carefully, not only the time, as given by the conductor, but all those little gesticulations by which expression is indicated.

In 1818-19 he gave concerts at Verona, Plaisance, Turin, and Florence, after which he visited Naples for the first time. His advent had been long looked for with feelings of jealous expectation and distrust. The chief professors and musicians of the place, who had never heard him, were not very favourably disposed. They, however, gave him a reception, on which occasion a piece of music was casually placed before him, full of the most ingenious difficulties that could be devised. PAGANINI was not unaccustomed to this kind of trap, and upon being requested to play it at sight, he merely glanced at it and played it off with the greatest ease. &nbsp;&nbsp;",1819-uu-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Naples,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/6c16b4ca81f2261b1da67a9d1cb1a666/1437842922957,Accompanied Domestic Indoor,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Professors+and+musicians+of+Naples/1437842888421,Professors and musicians of Naples,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Violin,

Sivori is&nbsp;dying to play us something classical of his own composition; and I — I have brought with me a new quartet by&nbsp;a young composer whose name I forget — he is a mere&nbsp;boy and none of you have ever heard of him — which I&nbsp;and my comrades here would like to play to Volkmann.&nbsp;Heckenast, I know you have a four- sided desk somewhere in this hovel of yours; produce it, and let us get&nbsp;to work. We will play in the next room, opening the&nbsp;folding doors, and my Englishman shall turn over. Our&nbsp;audience — including the maestro who looks so comfortable that I would not have him disturbed for the world —&nbsp;shall remain in here and listen, if they please to do so.""&nbsp;Sivori laughingly begged to be allowed to hear the ""new&nbsp;work"" before contributing his mite to the entertainment,&nbsp;and without further delay the prearranged ""surprise""&nbsp;was put into execution. Volkmann sat ensconced in a&nbsp;huge arm-chair, smoking a powerful Partagas, his eyes half-dosed, and his whole attitude expressive of that&nbsp;blissful state of body and mind, bight kief. As the&nbsp;executants commenced the spirited Allegro with which&nbsp;his G minor quartet opens, every eye was turned towards&nbsp;him. He started up, as though stricken by an electric&nbsp;shock, hastily put down his cigar and clutched both arms&nbsp;of the fauteuil, looking about him confusedly, like one&nbsp;suddenly awakened from a deep sleep. Presently, he&nbsp;sank back into his seat, covering his face with his hands;&nbsp;and when we next caught a glimpse of his sad grey eyes,&nbsp;they were wet with happy tears. Never before or since&nbsp;that memorable night have I heard the quartet — perhaps&nbsp;his most passionate and romantic composition for&nbsp;strings — so magnificently played, or so enthusiastically&nbsp;applauded. At its close, a shout of ""Eljen &amp; Volkmann!"" was raised by all present, and Heckenast called&nbsp;upon his guests to drink "" the Master's "" health in brimming bumpers of Roederer. Rendered speechless by&nbsp;glad emotion, Volkmann could only express his gratification by repeatedly pressing the artistic hands that had&nbsp;wrought him such paramount pleasure, his cheeks glistening the while with ""unfamiliar brine."" A little later,&nbsp;when he had recovered his self-possession, he sat down&nbsp;to the piano of his own accord and held us spellbound&nbsp;for some twenty minutes with an improvisation ""on a&nbsp;heroic subject"" (which I recognised years after in his&nbsp;recueil of ""Musical Poems,"" intituled ""Visegrad""),&nbsp;ever to be remembered by the survivors of that joyous&nbsp;company as an extempore production of unique beauty&nbsp;and indescribable fascination.&nbsp;",1867-uu-uu,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/0b0565cb9b2c6832d072132c489cd229,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/c9ebff7ea6e6436eee6864293f561396/1446673568176,Domestic Accompanied Indoor,http://musicbrainz.org/artist/55f78522-aceb-4487-948b-e9967363471f#_ http://musicbrainz.org/artist/b35e78cc-12c3-494f-a5a5-87a6a8e667ee#_ http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/William+Beatty-Kingston/1444079044346,Robert Volkmann Josef Hellmesberger William Beatty-Kingston,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Piano,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_music

I then heard her sing on two occasions. The first time was in the “Messe Solennelle"" of her beloved teacher and friend, Rossini, which the master had rescored for full orchestra some four years previous,—in fact, only a few months before he died. Thirteen years had elapsed since Alboni was last heard in London, and some time since she had retired from the stage altogether. Even then she was only in her forty-ninth year, and, despite her unusual stoutness, her tones retained well-nigh all their pristine charm of quality and organ-like richness of volume. What a magnificent voice it was! How marvelous— for a pure contralto—its evenness and range! Mr. Julian Marshall, in his article on Alboni in Grove's Dictionary, describes her compass as ""fully two octaves, from G to G."" To be correct, he should have added quite another half-octave to the head register and nearly as much below; for Alboni sang with perfect ease to the upper C, and could descend when she pleased to the middle space of the bass clef—altogether a scale extending not far short of three octaves! The purity and fluency of her style were indescribable.

In the spring of 1897 Giacomo Puccini paid his second visit to England, to superintend the production of his opera “La Boheme” by the Carl Rosa company at Manchester. The young Italian composer had achieved only a moderate success with his “Manon Lescaut"" at Covent Garden three years before, and was anxious to add to his laurels. On joining him at Manchester the afternoon of the premiere, I found him in very low spirits. He was not satisfied with the Carl Rosa artists, and fully anticipated a fiasco for the English representation of “La Boheme”. I assured him that Carl Rosa singers (as distinguished from Carl Rosa “directors”) did not know the meaning of the word “fail”; the intelligence and ensemble of the company were bound to pull him through. And so it proved. Deficient as it was in many respects, there was, nevertheless, so much spirit and animation about the performance, such a flavor of Bohemian jollity, that the opera instantly won the favor of the Lancashire audience and paved the way for its subsequent London success.",1897-uu-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Manchester,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/e9757cf04822ced8ffb283cfcb7d9793/1438596854310,Public Accompanied Indoor,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Hermann+Klein/1438157240872 http://dbpedia.org/resource/Giacomo_Puccini,Hermann Klein Giacomo Puccini,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

Close to the Conservatorium is the “ S. Thomas Schule,” part of which was once the house of Sebastian Bach, and in the gardens beneath it stands his statue. Deeply interested, I walked under the windows of the large, tall, quaint old building, and eventually found myself gazing at the statue of the most profound musician, the deepest thinker, the hardest worker of all the world’s musical heroes. “ Listen,” I said to my friend, “listen, the choir are singing one of the dear old Cantor’s motets,” as I recognized at once that splendid eight-part unaccompanied work in G Minor: [...] With the greatest firmness, accuracy, and in strict time by a choir of boys and men, was the piece sung, but interrupted occasionally, for I could hear everything distinctly, by the remarks of Dr. Richter, who caused the difficult passages to be sung again and again, until they were delivered perfectly.

She was a young and pretty girl of seventeen. The subjects had been written by the audience on slips of paper, and put into an urn, to be drawn out as occasion required. She recited three poems. The subject of the first was, the Sacrifice of Iphigenia;—the next, the Cestus of Venus;—and the last, Sappho presents a wreath of flowers to Phaon, was rendered more difficult by supplying her with the final words of each stanza, which she was to fill up with sense and rhymes. The final words, which were given by the audience, were all to end in ore;—some one suggested sartore—as a puzzling word for the conclusion of the last stanza; and if one might judge from the laughter and applause of the audience, for I confess I could not follow her, she brought it in with a very ingenious turn.
&nbsp;[…] 
&nbsp;Upon the whole, it was a wonderful performance; for though I could not catch all she said, one might judge of the merit of such a performance by the effect produced upon the audience. Besides, though words may add a great deal, they are not absolutely necessary to the expression of sentiment; the language of gestures, and features, and tones, is universal, and by the aid of these, it was easy to follow the story of Iphigenia perfectly.

It is not indeed a new hall, but an old one repaired, painted, and ornamented; it is in the same house where Bach lived, and is the very room where Bach, Hiller and others labored and conducted musical performances. Hauptmann now occupies the same apartments which were formerly occupied by the great Fuguist. The exercises, with the exception of a short address by one of the pupils, were exclusively musical, as follows:
I. Prayer. ""Kommet Lasset uns anbeten"", Hauptmann
II. Motette. ""Der Geist hilft unserer Schwachheit, J.S. Bach
III. Four part-songs:-
1. ""O Thaeler weit, o Hoehen"", Mendelssohn
2. ""O sanfter, suesser Hauch"", Mendelssohn
(The above may be found in the ""Social Glee Book,"" and have been sung in the Boston Musical Conventions.)
3. ""Waldeinsamkeit"", Hauptmann
4. ""Ich stand auf, Berges Hoehen"", Hauptmann
IV. Motette. ""Jauchzet dem Herrn"", Schicht.
The singing was by the choir of the school and church, which consisted of about fifty voices; Soprano and Alto by boys. It was entirely without accompaniment. A grand Pianoforte in the room was only used to announce the pitch before each piece.
[... H]ere is a chorus who stand up and sing Bach’s and other most difficult motets, the most difficult vocal music perhaps ever written, by voices alone, with as much certainty as the sure aim of an experienced marksman.
I think I have never before witnessed such devotion to the work as in these singers. Here is indeed entire self-committal. Every one throws all the powers he has, physical and spiritual, into the performance of the music. Every tone is attacked with a conscious certainty of success; no matter how complicated the rhythm, it is given with an energy and truthfulness that a first-rate violinist can hardly excel. The singers seem to have a perfect command of their vocal organs, and are no less certain of results than is the accomplished pianist when he strikes the keys, or the violinist when he draws the bow. There is an entire absence of that sleepiness, drowsiness, inattention, and foolish levity too often witnessed in our choirs. No looking about, or whispering, or laughing, or silliness; but close attention is ever manifested. I wish I had words to point out that consecration to the work, that deep, heartfelt interest which these choir members seem to possess; so that it might be sought for by our American singers. [...] I have never before heard a vocal chorus so prompt, so energetic, and perfect in time and tune, as on this occasion. The place, too, was holy ground, for all the great musicians have visited that saloon; Bach lived there as his home, and Handel, and Haydn, and Mozart, and Beethoven have been there. A new portrait of Bach (or rather an old one put in perfect order) has been placed at the head of the hall, and opposite to it is a fine bust of Schicht, who, though less known, was a very profound musician, as his works testify. On the whole, I have not attended a more interesting musical performance in Germany.

[Letter I] 
The convents only were left, to give us an idea of the society of Brindisi: let not this sentence astonish the reader, for his surprise must soon cease. The cloister and society! these certainly in former times were incompatible expressions, but they are now no longer so—we are told that the Jesuits gave to their order the title of a society, and that in fact they caused a revolution in the monasteries, which seem from this period to have almost become the asylum of tolerance, politeness, and proper enjoyment. The monks, without losing any of the dignity of their situation, have adopted the tone and manners of polished society. This change is very perceptible at Brindisi, where, without any exaggeration, nearly half the people are inhabitants of convents. The reason of this is very simple: in a confined situation, possessing neither the advantages of industry nor of commerce, the citizens are exposed for three-quarters of the year to obstinate maladies, which make them prefer the comfort and assistance which association affords to the solitude of a private family: the poverty of many individuals is another powerful cause. In the convents are found cheerful company, games of all kinds, and music; so that, in fact, their apartments are become saloons. We have visited several convents of females: the ladies crowded into the room, and shewed much anxiety to see us; they overwhelmed us with questions as frivolous as our answers, but some delightful music came to our assistance; voices such as we then heard are only found in cloisters; the hymns sung in perfect harmony, accompanied by the organ and other musical instruments, produced a great effect—it seemed almost like a concert of angels in the middle regions of the sky.",17Ll-uu-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brindisi,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/e56c506e6e66c68b6181496eaa695573/1517844019096,Accompanied Outdoor Public,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Antoine+Laurent+Castellan/1517842957331,Antoine-Laurent Castellan,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice http://dbpedia.org/resource/Female_vocals http://dbpedia.org/resource/Organ_(music),http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sacred

Another event deserves mention, viz., the first appearance, in England, of Sivori, the violinist at Her Majesty's Theatre, on the 18th May of this year. Much credit was due, I had heard, to the talent of this celebrated pupil of the great Paganini, and at once I decided to bring him to England. He was received by the opera-frequenters with admiration, even with enthusiasm. The instrument he played upon was the magic violin bequeathed to him by his dying master, and the fanciful legends of Italy having set afloat a notion that the soul of Paganini had taken refuge in the instrument, the popular ear, charmed by the young artist, listened credulously to the fable. Even in England the press declared that ""Sivori was not Sivori — it was Paganini restored to another generation in a renovated and younger form.""",http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/day/1843-05-18,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Her_Majesty's_Theatre,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/a74da3398c52062ba937308ca0813861/1438614695169,Public Indoor Accompanied,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Benjamin+Lumley/1438607277398,Benjamin Lumley,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Violin,

The conductor was Robert Schumann himself; the pianist was his wife. The orchestra was large, and the best that Leipzig could furnish. Robert Schumann has great celebrity, and especially in those cities where he has resided and has brought out his music under his own immediate direction. No one since Mendelssohn’s death stands so high in the estimation of the German musicians. There are places where he is not known, because his music is not understood; but even in these, and throughout Germany, he is regarded as standing at the very head of his profession, and no one commands aa. he does the universal attention of scientific men. Some go so far as to regard him as the greatest symphonist that has ever lived; but time can only determine this.
The concert had been advertised for some time, and the expectations of the lovers of music were fully awake. Not only were the musicians and lovers of music of Leipzig present, but literary and scientific men of the various professions, and the beauty, and wealth, and fashion of the city came to do homage to talent of so high an order, and to learning so extensive. Like the people at Lystra, so here, they lifted up their voices, saying, not in the speech of Lycaonia, but in that of Saxony ""The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men.”&nbsp;
[...]
But it was not only from this city that the audience was gathered on this occasion; it had been noised abroad that this concert was to be given, and musical men of high standing, Kapellmeisters and Concertmeisters, from the region round about, came up to Leipzig. Berlin, Dresden, Weimar, and other places were represented. At the head of this foreign company, and indeed at the head of the whole company, was Lis[zt];— the very Lis[zt] himself came from Weimar to listen, and to pay honor to greatness. But Robert Schumann is not alone, he has a “help meet” indeed. Clara Wieck was perhaps the most distinguished female pianist who has ever lived; and, unlike many ladies, she did not give up her instrument when she became Clara Schumann, but rather devoted herself with greater assiduousness under her new instructor, than she had previously done under the teachings of her father, to the profession which had been the choice of both her husband and herself. No wonder that the people should assemble on the occasion of a visit from this far-famed couple. But they came not to hear any one sing or play on an instrument, for although the wife is indeed a most accomplished pianist, yet the husband neither plays nor sings; but they rather came to hear the new music that the master had produced. They looked for some new musical revelation, for new chords (if possible), or new progressions; at least some new method of treatment, or harmonic development was expected. It was not to be the same tune over again. They went away satisfied; for, not only was the musical performance pronounced to be one of the very best, but the music, or the principal piece of attraction, was regarded as worthy of its author.
The first piece was the “Overture zu L. Byron's Manfred&nbsp;von R. Schumann,"" This is an overture in the true learned German style, and as unlike the overtures of the modem Italian and French schools as can be imagined; of course, it cannot be popular, that is, it cannot take with the people generally; on this occasion, however, it was fully appreciated and listened to, by one of the most intelligent musical audiences that could be brought together in Germany, with unmingled delight. The second piece was “Concert No. 2, F moll, fur Piano Forte mit Begleitung des or Chester, von F. Chopin,” performed by Clara Schumann. This is said to be in Chopin’s peculiar style, and one of his most difficult productions. Mad. Schumann played it with apparent ease, and with a delicacy of touch and distinctness of articulation not to be excelled. She has not so great a power as some; in this respect she resembles Chopin himself, but in everything else requisite to the perfection of piano forte playing she is fully accomplished. The third piece was a song by Herr Behr, necessary for variety’s sake; after which Mad. Schumann played most charmingly two pieces- “Andantino von W. Sterndale Bennett"" and ""Lied ohne Worte (F major), von F. Mendelssohn Bartholdy.”
The second part of the concert (and here was the attraction) consisted of “Die Pilgerfahrt der Rose” (the pilgrimage of the rose), a new composition for voices (solo and chorus) and orchestra by Robert Schumann. This has been performed here a week or two before, and was noticed in a previous communication. Anything like an analytical notice of it from one who has heard it but once or twice would hardly be expected, and in the present case it would be quite absurd. It will be known in a few years. The orchestra never played better; the idea of playing under Schumann inspired every man with new life and energy, and the improvement in the performance of the music under the direction of the composer (there having been a previous rehearsal also under his teaching), was said to be very apparent. We can hardly imagine a musical occasion that would be more interesting or exciting especially to the truly enlightened musician than this. For the few details here given we are indebted to others, for we did not attend this concert; we neither saw the sight nor heard the sound thereof. Why? It was given on Sunday Morning, March 14th, at 11 o'clock.",http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/day/1852-03-14,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/0a19459865ed69275723d6efb76048c9,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/b70ced96635c68b59cb35c543a81c1f2/1448285137585,Accompanied Indoor Public,http://musicbrainz.org/artist/f422b99a-b48c-4bee-bc0c-f2e8cad82b6c#_ http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Franz+Liszt/1424794451085,Dr. Lowell Mason Lowell Mason Franz Liszt,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Piano,

Owing to the fact (I suppose) that there were several distinguished solo singers here, the first part of the concert consisted more of vocal music than usual. A chorus of men’s voices was also introduced, and large extracts were given from Cherubini’s opera of “Ali Baba,"" and from Rossini’s “Wilhelm Tell,"" also an aria from Don Juan by Mozart. Two overtures were admirably played, viz.: Leonore No. 2, Beethoven, and William Tell, Rossini. The fine chorus of men’s voices added much to the interest of the concert, but the principal piece was the charming A minor Symphony No. 3, by Mendelssohn. I have often heard this magnificent production of Mendelssohn performed at home, but it is no discredit to our orchestras to say that it is quite a different thing when given with the precision of the Gewandhaus orchestra. I will attempt no description; suffice it to say that it was the perfection of orchestral music — so soft and so loud, so melancholy and so joyful, so exciting and so soothing, so expressive and so effective — imagine it, ye who have no opportunity of hearing it.",1852-01-Ll,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gewandhaus,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/698b6d5ea925741fdcc7ee4cc7cc1854/1448278139907,Accompanied Public Indoor,http://musicbrainz.org/artist/f422b99a-b48c-4bee-bc0c-f2e8cad82b6c#_,Dr. Lowell Mason Lowell Mason,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Overture

Proceeding along the corridor as soon as dressed, we soon met Lord Delaware and the Duchess of Buccleuch, and were directed where to go, that is, to walk to the end of the corridor (a fairy scene, lights, pictures, busts, and moving figures of courtiers unknown), and then through one splendid room after another, till we reached the magnificent ballroom, where guests were assembled to await the Queen's appearance. Among these guests stood the King himself, punctual to half-past seven. Soon after came Prince Albert, to whom Lord Delaware named me : he said, ' You were long in Rome. I have been in your house at Rome.' We had not stood long, when two gentlemen, walking in, and then turning, with profound bows towards the open door, showed that the Queen was approaching. She came near at once where I stood; the Duchess of Buccleuch named me, and she said with a gracious, beaming smile, ' I am pleased to see you ; ' then, after a few moments' speaking to the King, she took his arm and moved on, 'God save the Queen' having begun to sound at the same moment from the Waterloo Gallery, where the Royal dinner has always taken place since the King has been here.",1842-Ee-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Windsor_Castle,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/http://data.open.ac.uk/led/music/God+Save+the+Queen/1393599303611/1433945994654,Indoor Accompanied,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/King+of+Prussia/1375807441992 http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Lord+Delaware/1433945907505 http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Queen+Victoria/1393599242108 http://dbpedia.org/resource/Christian_Charles_Josias_von_Bunsen http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Albert/1385142265729 http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Duchess+of+Buccleuch/1433945931766,"King of Prussia Lord Delaware Queen Victoria Christian Charles Josias, Baron von Bunsen Baron von Bunsen Christian Karl Josias von Bunsen Christian Charles Josias von Bunsen Prince Albert Albert, Prince Consort Duchess of Buccleuch",Performance,,http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_anthem http://dbpedia.org/resource/Patriotic_song

This invitation was the result of a strong conviction on the part of Niebuhr of the propriety of making such a demonstration of respect, both to his countrymen and to the grandees of Rome, and to the diplomatic body ; and having once made up his mind to do this, the fete was carried out with grand effect, the locality having the advantage, ever belonging to Roman palaces, of suitable space. A fete of the ordinary kind, either with dancing, or a performance of theatrical music, was felt to be too incongruous with the character and taste of the great historian, to be admissible; moreover, it was wholly unsuited to the serious aspect of a house and family, over which the ill-health of Madame Niebuhr cast a continual shadow. In the difficulty of selection of a means of giving object and character to the invitation of a mixed multitude, Bunsen's original suggestion was gladly accepted by Niebuhr, who obtained the assent of Consalvi in the name of the Pope, while Bunsen negotiated on his part with Baini, the selection of singers and of pieces ; in which last the judgement of Kocher was also consulted : and the Missa Papae Marcelli (an early and comparatively cheerful and popular work of Palestrina), the anthem ' Tu es Petrus' (belonging to the Papal Corona tion service, also by Palestrina), and the grand Dies irae (of Pittoni, somewhat later than Palestrina), were chosen as being most effective. Niebuhr himself was neither musical, nor in general fond of music, but he was as susceptible of grand devotional strains, as he was of the echoes of the weal and woe of human races to be found in national melodies: and so far, like Bunsen, he admired what his philosophical reflection approved.",182u-uu-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rome,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/http://data.open.ac.uk/led/music/Tu+es+Petrus/1433771812964/1433771812976,Indoor Accompanied,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Barthold_Georg_Niebuhr http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Prime+Minister+of+Prussia/1433771572593 http://dbpedia.org/resource/Christian_Charles_Josias_von_Bunsen http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Prince+Hardenberg/1386076559167 http://dbpedia.org/resource/Heinrich_Friedrich_Karl_vom_und_zum_Stein,"Barthold Georg Niebuhr Prime Minister of Prussia Christian Charles Josias, Baron von Bunsen Baron von Bunsen Christian Karl Josias von Bunsen Christian Charles Josias von Bunsen Prince Hardenberg Baron Stein",Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vocal_music http://dbpedia.org/resource/Religious_music http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chorale

Thus, with a scene of unequalled dramatic splendour, ends the fourth and last immense drama of the Niebelung's Ring. This is not the place for fuller criticism of such a work. At the close of it the pent-up enthusiasm of the public rose to a pitch of frenzy. They stood up, and, turning to the Royal box, which WAGNER had left, shouted to the King, who remained seated and bowed graciously. The plaudits continuing, His Majesty motioned to the stage. The people turned, and in a moment WAGNER, dressed in plain black, with his hat in one hand, stepped out from the middle of the curtain, and stood motionless with his grey head uncovered until repeated cries of ""Sit down!"" ""Sit down!"" and ""Hush!"" had calmed the assembly. WAGNER then spoke very quietly, and I regret that not hearing him quite distinctly at moments I am unable to render verbatim a speech which has doubtless been elsewhere recorded. I understood him to say he had taken many years in preparing this work; that he had presented a Saga of the Niebelung in the belief that it dealt with subjects peculiarly congenial to the Germanic races; that a new and national development of the drama was now within their reach; he believed that they had been satisfied with what they had listened to, so that it had been to the many assembled there a real Festspiel. He then thanked the King for his support and encouragement; and, the curtain being suddenly lifted, all the crowd of musicians and actors who had taken part in the Festival stood ranged, and WAGNER, turning round, thanked them in the warmest terms for their devotion and assistance. So ended the first great Wagner Festival, held at Bayreuth in 1876.",1876-08-uu,,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/890e0da28e1cd39c80a6021ff748342f/1438001597662,Accompanied Outdoor Public,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hugh_Reginald_Haweis,Hugh Reginald Haweis,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

How often do we perceive them either not listening at all, or with the most languid attention, to the sublimest compositions, both vocal and instrumental; to which, when a trifling ballad has succeeded, its notes have been imbibed with eager transport, and dismissed with vollies of applause. A great master takes a common country-dance as the subject of his solo, and forms, upon that worthless ground, the most elegant embroidery that florid and inventive fancy, united to consummate taste, can produce. Strange it is, to observe no general transport expressed during those daring efforts of ingenuity, while his return to Malbrook, or ""Come, haste to the wedding,"" has been hailed with the glance of delight from a thousand eyes.

What a solemn tragedy of human passion we had been assisting at ! Not a heart there but could interpret that struggle between the flesh and the spirit from its own experiences. Not one but knew the desperately wicked and deceitful temptations that come like enchantresses in the wizard's garden, to plead the cause of the devil in the language of high-flown sentiment or even religious feeling. Praise and criticism seemed dumb; we rather walked and spoke of what we had just witnessed like men convinced of judgment, and righteousness, and sin. It was a strange mood in which to come out of a theatre after witnessing what would commonly be called an "" Opera."" I felt more than ever the impossibility of producing the Parsifal in London, at Drury Lane or Covent Garden, before a well-dressed company of loungers, who had well dined, and were on their way to balls and suppers afterwards.

The composer of “Esmeralda"" had been fortunate enough to discover a new librettist in Mr. Julian Sturgis, an American litterateur unknown to fame in England, who had submitted a promising scenario upon a Russian subject. The title of the new opera was ""Nadeshda."" Goring Thomas devoted the best part of 1884 to writing the music, and it was announced for production at Drury Lane in April, 1885. Unusual secrecy was observed with regard to the work,— almost as much, in fact, as in the case of a new Savoy opera,— but I persuaded the composer to lend me an advance copy of the book, and published a notice of the story in the “Sunday Times”. This evoked the following letter from the ever-nervous Carl Rosa: 
10 Warwick Crescent, Maida Hill, W. 24th March, 1885. 
Dear Klein: I saw the “Nadeshda” plot today, and must confess it is admirably written. But where did you get the material from— from an artist, eh? I have only this morning sent words of the tenor song now to be sung to the printer's, and did not want to get copies in the hands of the press before the book was complete. 
Sincerely yours, Carl Rosa. “Nadeshda” made an instantaneous success. It was pronounced immeasurably stronger than “Esmeralda”, the music showing a wonderful advance alike in originality and dramatic grip. Handsomely staged by Augustus Harris, splendidly sung by Alwina Valleria, Josephine Yorke, Barton McGuckin, and Leslie Crotty, it achieved the hit of the season and evoked eulogies that must have delighted the soul of the modest composer. During the following autumn and winter, “Nadeshda” was brought out in several Continental cities, and, knowing how little Goring Thomas sought advertisement on these occasions, I used to take pleasure in letting him know what was going on.",1885-04-uu,,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/24b7cd899296241f93de877f6c656a72/1438253305824,Indoor Accompanied Public,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Hermann+Klein/1438157240872,Hermann Klein,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

""Linda di Chamouni"" was produced, for the benefit of Madame Persiani, on the 1st of June. The cast, including Persiani herself, Brambrilla, Mario, Lablache, Fornasari, and Federico Lablache, was a great, almost a perfect one. The town was ""taken by storm,"" and I was universally congratulated on the great success achieved. It is somewhat curious to see how the musical world of that day contrived to recede from the previous tones of depreciation with which it had been the fashion to receive the operas of Donizetti, ""Dramas of a higher class,"" people affirmed, ""were unsuited to Donizetti's powers. Unable to cope with the grand and terrible, he can treat a subject like this with considerable feeling."" He had displayed ""more aim at the chaste and pathetic, less confidence in naive and unmeaning common-place."" He was suddenly found to possess ""to a considerable degree the gift of melody."" And so on, and so on, in varied phrase of retractation. Some of the would-be consistent, it is true, declared the music ""poor,"" with ""no richness of harmony, no depth of combination,"" or admitted, at most, that it was the ""least offensive"" of Donizetti's operas.

One episode in the Club’s history may be of some little interest. We arrived one morning in a certain Michigan town, and were met at the railroad station by a friend of long standing. In a very serious tone of voice he informed me that another good friend of the Club, a ’cello amateur, was so far gone in consumption that his physician and family had given him up; he would probably die during the day. The expected visit of the Mendelssohn Quintette Club had apparently kept him alive; he wanted to hear the Tema con Variazioni from the Schubert D-minor Quartette before he gave up the ghost He had placed a sum of money in the teacher’s hands to pay us. Would we gratify him ?
The situation quite shocked me. I said, “Of course we will play, but don’t talk of money.”
The sick friend was at the same hotel in which we were to be quartered. The plan was for us to play in a room at some little distance from his, but with both doors open. He wanted the music to reach his ears as a last sweet echo of his departing musical pleasures.
We prepared to play very soon after our arrival at the hotel. To me, who knew the young man well, it was a very solemn moment. &nbsp;To play under such circumstances required some self-possession.
On a lower floor in the hotel lay a brother of the sick man who was also in a rapid decline, and very near death. The mother was in attendance at his bedside. Scarcely had we reached the middle of the piece, when a messenger from the mother came to request us to stop, for the brother down-stairs was so affected that she feared immediate death. We ceased playing. This latter brother died during the ensuing night; but the one who wanted the music lived on, and some favorable change occurred which gave him a fresh lease of life,—good for some years after the time he thought he was to hear his parting Swan Song",180u-Ll-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Michigan,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/bbf972a00c9c22609461b54fb05b64b6/1450277222298,Domestic Accompanied Indoor,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Thomas+Ryan/1448997315048,Thomas Ryan,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chamber_orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_music

The subject of the fugue was, perhaps, a little too chromatic for the dignity of worship, but it was played slowly and with great precision and certainty.
At the close of the voluntary, the minister, followed by the session, entered; the former took his place in the pulpit; the latter took their places in seats appropriated to them, on each side, facing the congregation. The organ then gave out the tune Iosco — the melody was made very prominent, the bass was played by the pedals, and an intermediate figured accompaniment filled up the harmony, producing a fine effect. The hymn, the subject of which was prayer to Jesus for his spirit, was finely sung by the whole assembly, all singing the melody. At the end of the first line of the last stanza, which was doxological, the minister rose in the pulpit, not to find his place in the Bible as if he was in a hurry to cut off the last act of praise, but apparently as an act of reverence, as he kept standing, without any movement, and was soon followed in his example by all the male part of his congregation. A short prayer followed the hymn; then an address (extempore) of four or five minutes; after this the regular morning prayer was read; another hymn was sung as before, and the sermon followed. There were two hymns sung afterwards, making four times singing during the exercises. Here was a very simple, appropriate, devotional service for a Sabbath morning, — almost the same, indeed, as is the religious service in our Presbyterian, Baptist, or Congregational churches, and vastly superior to the Lutheran or English Cathedral repetitions and forms.",1852-06-Mm,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/06e3de3de77d9ffc37f51e63e679237b,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/3084c06fd50d3eb0b96e642918e7a513/1448360072673,Accompanied Indoor Public,http://musicbrainz.org/artist/f422b99a-b48c-4bee-bc0c-f2e8cad82b6c#_,Dr. Lowell Mason Lowell Mason,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pipe_organ http://data.open.ac.uk/led/thing/congregation,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hymn

Another friend whom I often saw during my Albion Street days was the late Lady Sandhurst, who asked me to give her piano lessons. She was such a dear!

The other venture was an opera buffa of Donizetti's early time, ""Don Gregorio,"" the libretto of which was founded on a French vaudeville. The music was light and sparkling, and the selection had been made to afford the great Lablache the opportunity of appearing in a new buffo part; one, too, in which he had been received with delight in Paris. But matter for attack was made out of this piece forthwith. The unfortunate opera buffa (capitally sung and acted by Lablache, Mario, Fornasari, and Madame Castellan), was doomed to execration. ""Desecration of the stage,"" ""insult to the subscribers,"" ""disgraceful buffoonery” were among the phrases launched against it with the force of a catapult.

The last vibration of the AVE MARIA BELL was tingling, the last sun-light was fading from the bending tower of the Assinello; the shadows of the arched porticos deepened, and the miracles and processions painted in fresco on the walls of convents and monasteries (for a moment visible) sunk rapidly in the sudden gloom which terminates Italian twilight. The joyous sounds of the vintage had died away, and were succeeded by the solemn silence, the cloistral sobriety, of the learned Bologna of the middle ages—the retreat of studious abstraction and monastic severity. As the evening advanced, and the moon rose, the tingling of guitars was heard, the imagery of Shakspeare's plays (one scarcely knew why) was recalled; and when we returned to our Hotel, the ""Ciechi,"" a delightful band of blind musicians, who play for hire in the streets of Bologna till midnight, were already assembled to hail other travellers, as well as ourselves, at the [Hotel] Pellegrino; and to symphonize a supper which would have done credit to a Parisian restaurateur.",18Ee-uu-uuTLl:ll:ll,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bologna,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/8dd09bb74f2ff14533c49885888afe6e/1516534989524,Outdoor Accompanied Public,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Lady+Sydney+Morgan/1515698191138,Lady Sydney Morgan,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Guitar,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Instrumental

We had a full house in the local concert hall. I noticed when we began to play that the front row of seats was empty, evidently reserved for some special people. Those “specials” came in while we played our first piece. They were Indians, about twelve in number, some being “blanket Indians”—which means that they wore their brilliant blue and yellow striped blankets shawl-wise, and their buckskin moccasins, and that their faces and front hair were painted. The rest of the party were dressed like good, stock-raising American farmers, but were unmistakably Indians. I was told there was a father with six sons in the party, all very large, broad-shouldered men. They filed quietly into their seats, preceded by a local guide, in whose hands they seemed like good, docile children.
[…] &nbsp;
No shadow of emotion could be seen on their countenances.
The fifth number of the programme was a violin solo played by Mr. Schultze, and for an encore he gave a little caprice entitled, The Bird in the Tree, a charming jeu d'esprit, by Miska Hauser, which represents the joyful, almost delirious, singing of a wild bird in the woods. The moment Mr. Schultze began this piece, the Indians were all alive, their eyes sparkled with pleasure, and they nudged each other with their elbows. And when the little bird-melody and imitations of bird singing began (all done in high harmonic, flageolet tones on the violin), they looked all around the ceiling and the walls, doubtless expecting to see singing-birds flitting about. Not seeing any, they looked at the violinist, and began to understand that he was the magician. The surprise, and almost incredulity, which was depicted on the faces of these children of nature was a rare show in itself. At its conclusion they jumped up and down just as little children do when something unusual pleases them.
This violin piece ended the first part of the programme. Our second part began with another serious piece, and the twelve pairs of eyes lapsed into the ox-like placidity again. Very shortly the red men had had enough of us “ freaks,” and they quietly rose and filed out of the hall.",180u-Ll-uu,"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Topeka,_Kansas",http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/5083f131cd1ddd8f55caa65259c26341/1450350149584,Accompanied Public Indoor,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Thomas+Ryan/1448997315048 http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/unknown+listeners/1448992475370,Thomas Ryan unknown listeners,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chamber_orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Light_music

""Perhaps he has some talent for music” said the sick man as he heard little RICHARD, then only seven years old, strumming a tune from Der Freyschutz on the &nbsp;piano. It was Louis GEYER, his step-father; painter, author, and actor, then on his death-bed, thinking of the future, planning as dying men plan, and hitting the mark as they often hit it, quite at random. The child's vivid temperament and eager, sensitive mind had always made him a favourite with the actor and the poet, and he thought of making a painter of RICHARD, but the boy seemed to have no turn for it. His mother, a woman full of life and imagination, was less anxious and more wise. She let him grow, and happily he was left to her, ""with no education"" as he says, ""but life, art, and myself.""",1821-uu-uu,,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/42bdf1e928f0b19c9a6fadd238a07655/1437845236261,Indoor Solitary Domestic,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Ludwig+Geyer/1437845174278,Ludwig Geyer,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Piano,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

The features of the season of 1893 were the first visits to London of Leoncavallo and Mascagni,&nbsp;and the production there of their respective operas, “Pagliacci” and “I Rantzau”. The fame &nbsp;of Leoncavallo's sensational opera had preceded &nbsp;it, and the public expected something remarkable. &nbsp;They were not disappointed. I have rarely seen&nbsp;an audience so breathless with excitement over&nbsp;the development of an opera plot. The effect of &nbsp;the little tragedy was augmented by the burning&nbsp;intensity of De Lucia, whose portrayal of the hapless Canio's anguish and suffering was a triumph&nbsp;of realism. His touching soliloquy at the end of &nbsp;the first act was delivered with an abandonment &nbsp;of feeling that completely carried away his auditors. Very fine, too, was Ancona's rendering of the &nbsp;already famous Prologue; deliciously pure and &nbsp;sweet was Melba's vocalization in the haUateUa&nbsp;for Nedda; excellent were the new-comers Richard Green and Bonnard as Silvio and Peppe; &nbsp;while Mancinelli's conducting left not a point &nbsp;undiscerned throughout. Leoncavallo, modest&nbsp;and unassuming, waited quietly in the background &nbsp;till the end, and then had to be forced on to the&nbsp;stage by the artists to acknowledge the ovation &nbsp;that awaited him. This was quite early in the&nbsp;season (May 19), and Leoncavallo remained in &nbsp;London for several weeks. I found him to be&nbsp;a man of great culture and strong intellect. He is&nbsp;a poet as well as a musician, and in both arts he &nbsp;reveals the grasp of a profound thinker. &nbsp; ",http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/day/1893-05-19,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Covent_Garden,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/c73dcd54516f19555848f7f1077f01c7/1438531362480,Public Indoor Accompanied,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Hermann+Klein/1438157240872,Hermann Klein,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

Such morning concerts are quite common in the larger German cities. An individual, having the means to do it, employs at his own expense an orchestra, or more probably a quartet, or quintet, makes out his own programme, and invites his friends to spend a couple of hours in listening to fine music. On the present occasion, an audience of perhaps two hundred persons (the most musical people of Frankfort) were brought together. Schindler, the biographer of Beethoven, Schmidt the pianist, and other distinguished persons, were present. The concert consisted of both vocal and instrumental music; and Music’s sister, Elocution, was also brought in, and lent her aid in the exercises of the occasion. The programme contained the following pieces (though not in the order in which they are here put down), viz.:— &nbsp;Quintet (G. minor), Mozart, charmingly — I suppose it may be, said, perfectly played by Messrs. Wolff, Baldenecker, Posch, Drinnenberg, and Siedentopf. Quintet Movement, Mozart. This very beautiful movement by Mozart has not before been played since the year 1783. It has been recently discovered in Mozart’s own hand-writing, among his manuscripts, which for some twenty years have been in the family of André of Offenbach. It will shortly be published. Recitative and Air, with violoncello and obligato accompaniment, composed by John Sebastian Bach. This song is quite of a popular character, notwithstanding it is by Bach, reminding one somewhat of Handel’s most popular songs. It is a sacred song, from an unpublished cantate; but the Recitative and Song will soon be published. Part-Songs, for soprano, alto, tenor, and bass. Two songs were sung by a well-trained double quartet. A Poem on Mozart was well read by a lady, having a rich alto voice, Fraulein Gräemann. The effect of introducing this elocutionary exercise was very pleasing, and the example is a good one to be followed wherever a really excellent reader can be found to sustain the part. Strangers are sometimes invited to play in these concerts; and on the present occasion two pianoforte pieces, “Amitie pour amitie,” composed by the performer, and Doneyschock’s Rhapsodie in C. Minor, were played by Mr. William Mason of Boston, U. S.

The dinner-party at the Embassy was a small one, no other company being invited except Mr. and Mrs. G ,Mademoiselle Lind, Madame Catalani and her daughter, and one English gentleman, a well-known amateur of the opera; the secretary of Embassy, and a sister of the Ambassadress being also present. After dinner, the weather being warm the party strolled in the garden attached to the Embassy — Catalani and Jenny Lind talking much together. In the evening, some little embarrassment arose about asking Jenny Lind to sing, because, as no one ever refuses a request made by the representative of majesty, the Marchioness considerately forbore to place the young Swede in a position of difficulty. But Catalani, who was burning vsdth curiosity to hear Jenny Lind sing, perceived that there was some hesitation, went up to the ""Nightingale,"" and asked her with grace and earnestness to oblige the company with a song, adding, ""C'est la vieille Catalani qui desire vous entendre chanter, avant de mourir !"" 
Such an appeal from such a person, overcame all Jenny's habitual dislike to sing in private society. She sat down to the piano, and after a few bars of prelude, gave her incomparable ""Non credea mirarti,"" playing the accompaniment herself. 
Now, the salon at the Embassy was exceedingly ill-adapted for vocal display, being crowded with stuffed sofas, chairs, and other heavy furniture, curtains inclusive. Jenny Lind's beautiful voice was consequently heard under sensible disadvantage; moreover, she had to sing in a sitting posture instead of standing up. Nevertheless, the many obvious merits of her style, taste, and execution enchanted the Italian ear of Catalani, who sat on the ottoman in the centre of the room, enjoying the rare treat, rocking her body to and fro with delight and sympathy, and murmuring (loud enough to be overheard by Mrs. G, who sat by her side), ""Ah! la bella cosa che la musica, quando si fa di quella maniera !"" — and again, ""Ah ! la carissima ! quanto bellissima !"" Of course expression of cordial thanks and admiration on the part of all present followed the performance; and before separating for the night, Jenny was good enough to sing one or two more ""arias"" (among which ""Ah! non Giunge"" was included), to the renewed gratification of the interesting ""ex-prima donna.""",1849-06-uu,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/a7c15226ad7a1fd189ae4c2002d6d183,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/9ef959d82ec1999b11770e6d6b29f4ab/1438769085361,Accompanied Domestic Indoor,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Angelica+Catalani/1438769014649,Angelica Catalani,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice http://dbpedia.org/resource/Piano,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aria

Then Mr. Gierlow resigned, and Francis Riha, the former leader of the Steyermark Orchestra, took his place and thus became the second violin. We played very much together and got into fine trim.
Mr. Bigelow, who was our fatherly friend, and remained such all through life, suggested that we should prepare to give concerts, and make that a part of our life-work. The question of a name naturally came up. Mendelssohn was on the top of the musical wave at that time, and, as we had practised his quintette, Opus 18, till we could venture to play it in public, it was determined to call our party, The Mendelssohn Quintette Club of Boston.

A still severer trial attended the illustrious prima donna on the boards of the theatre. On Thursday the 11th of July she appeared (now ""for the last time on any stage"") in a selection of ""scenes"" from ""Anna Bolena."" The part of the afflicted queen had been one of the greatest among her characters. Curiosity had been stimulated to a very powerful degree, and the house was crowded in every part. Madame Pasta appeared, to be hailed with prolonged acclamations. There she stood once more, on the scene of her past glories, ""every inch a Queen."" The spectacle was deeply interesting ; yet it was melancholy, not to say painful, to all who could feel with true artistic sympathy. With the noble presence and the lofty air of the Pasta of old days, she moved like a mighty shadow of the past before the eyes of the spectators; but it was the ""shadow of a shade."" The qualities already mentioned — the faultless style, the finished phrasing, the grand declamation, were all greeted with something more than respect, whilst the imaginative among the audience may have figured to themselves, like clever geologists, out of the shattered remains of the great vocal Mammoth, a perfect creature of former times. But the general sentiment was one of disappointment and regret. ""Is this all that remains of so wonderful a past?"" was the regretful exclamation of the young. ""It had been better that our hopeful recollection had never been disturbed and dimmed by so sad a ghost,"" thought the old. The ""longing, lingering look behind "" had literally been taken by the great prima donna. That she damaged her great fame by taking it, cannot be said. Her ""last appearance"" was soon forgotten in the turmoil of operatic events; whilst her name still gleams with tra- ditional lustre in the annals of lyric fame.",http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/day/1850-07-11,,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/af0a6e9d1e99bf3355fa5a548f92fe45/1438783504397,Indoor Accompanied Public,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Benjamin+Lumley/1438607277398,Benjamin Lumley,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Recital

Public performances by some one of them are very frequent; so frequent indeed, that we can find time for only now and then one. The first for the season was by the ""Sacred Harmonic Society,"" under Mr. Costa, and consisted of a selection from ""Samson,"" by Handel, Mendelssohn's ""Christus,"" ""The Last Judgment,"" by Spohr. The death of the illustrious Duke gave a tinge to all the earlier concerts, and the ""Dead March"" in Saul was in constant requisition. On the present occasion, the selection from ""Samson"" consisted of the air, ""Ye Sons of Israel,"" ""Dead March,"" and chorus,&nbsp;
""Glorious hero, may thy grave&nbsp;Peace and honor ever have.""&nbsp;
The ""Christus"" by Mendelssohn, seems to be very popular, both among the singers and hearers. The chorale, ""As bright the Star of Morning gleams,"" one of the best German chorales, and one that is very often heard in their churches, is brought in with fine effect after the chorus, ""There shall a Star of Jacob&nbsp;come forth."" Mendelssohn is always great in such choruses as ""He stirreth up the Jews,"" ""Crucify Him,"" and others in which he depends mostly upon orchestral effect, and in which he carries out his ideas of imitation or description with all the powers of modem instrumentation.&nbsp;
Spohr's oratorio was well given, the Gresham Professor himself being judge; for we had the honor of a seat by his side, and of listening to his remarks during the perormance. Mr. Taylor was the first to bring out Spohr in England. ""Die letzten Dinge,"" or ""The Last Things,"" (which is a much better title for the oratorio than the one it now bears,) was composed about twenty-five years ago. It accidently came into the hands of Prof. Taylor, who translated the words, and first brought it out at the Norwich Festival in 1830. Since then it has been a standard oratorio, and is often performed. Prof. Taylor says: ""It at once seized the public attention, and commanded the admiration of the most distinguished professors of every school. Its influences upon the feelings of an audience has been attested by expressions more decided and unequivocal than I ever remember to have witnessed. I speak not of the admiration which the musician derives from such a display of the power and the resources of his art, but of the homage which nature, though musically untutored, involuntarily yet willingly pays to genius. The throbbing heart, the moistening eye, the quivering lip, here bespeak the triumph of the composer."" The solo parts&nbsp;were sustained by Mrs. Endersohn, Miss Williams, Mr. Lockey and Mr. Phillips.&nbsp;
We cannot enter into the detail of this performance; suffice it to say, that it afforded some of the best specimens of solo, quartet and chorus singing which we have ever heard. It was&nbsp;performed with admirable promptitude and exactness, as is everything else that is brought under the bâton of Mr. Costa.",http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/day/1853-01-11,http://dbpedia.org/resource/London,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/721ebad0960d565b02673a2b9dc5392d/1461779600490,Accompanied Public Indoor,http://musicbrainz.org/artist/f422b99a-b48c-4bee-bc0c-f2e8cad82b6c#_ http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Edward+Taylor/1461779056247,Dr. Lowell Mason Lowell Mason Edward Taylor,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra http://dbpedia.org/resource/Choir,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oratorio

[Marie Barnard] was a genius in her line. She travelled with us for two seasons, and then went to Paris to prepare for the operatic stage. She has since developed into a good actress under the name of Marie Bama.
When leaving for Europe she promised to find a singer to replace her. In a very few weeks she cabled me, “ Have found fine singer for you.” In due season Miss Lila Juel arrived, young, tall, handsome, and a Swede. She sang with me for two years. It would be difficult to find a better concert singer or a more amiable person.",188u-uu-uu,,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/9eea92660cffd3d2864238ed6bb05c7b/1449480482961,,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Thomas+Ryan/1448997315048,Thomas Ryan,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soprano http://dbpedia.org/resource/Female_vocals,

We visited the cathedral of SAN GIOVANNI during the celebration of the service. The canons, in their scarlet robes, were installed on either side of the altar.

The prayers, litany, &amp;c. were all intoned or recited to the plain chant of the canons of the cathedral, with the usual responses by the choir. The psalms for the day were chanted by the choir, consisting of sixteen or eighteen boys and men, who also sung the canticles set in the service or anthem form, by Dr. Nares.
The chanting was poor enough, at least, for three reasons: 1st. Great rapidity of utterance. 2d. No two members of the choir kept together. 3d. The enunciation of the words was so careless that it was with difficulty one could keep the place and follow the performance, even with book in hand. There was of course, nothing like attention to the sense of the psalms - there was no appropriate emphasis, or any more expression, than would be given by a hand-organ or grind-stone. The great leading object seemed to be to hurry on, and get through as quickly as possible. One good point, however, in the chanting was the absence of all drawling in the cadences.

And now the career of the distinguished artist approached to its close for the season of 1848, On Thursday, August the 24th, Mademoiselle Lind sang ""La Sonnambula"" for the last time. Her welcome of the 4th of May previous could scarcely have been surpassed in the amount of rapture and enthusiasm to which a great theatre could give vent; but yet it was almost ""o'ertopped"" by the tumult of applause, the waving of hats and handkerchiefs, and the long protracted lingering, and still lingering cheer which bade farewell to the great singer on this night.

This symphony is even a more powerful display of the author's imagination than that of the Pastorale. He wrote it in honour of Bonaparte, and intended to call it the Sinfonia de Napoleon ; but, the Consul assuming the imperial robe, Beethoven said he was no better than the rest of the tyrants that had preceded him, and changed the title to that of the 'Death of a Hero.'

Close to the Conservatorium is the “ S. Thomas Schule,” part of which was once the house of Sebastian Bach, and in the gardens beneath it stands his statue. Deeply interested, I walked under the windows of the large, tall, quaint old building, and eventually found myself gazing at the statue of the most profound musician, the deepest thinker, the hardest worker of all the world’s musical heroes. “ Listen,” I said to my friend, “listen, the choir are singing one of the dear old Cantor’s motets,” as I recognized at once that splendid eight-part unaccompanied work in G Minor: [...] With the greatest firmness, accuracy, and in strict time by a choir of boys and men, was the piece sung, but interrupted occasionally, for I could hear everything distinctly, by the remarks of Dr. Richter, who caused the difficult passages to be sung again and again, until they were delivered perfectly.

What was at that time designated the ""real"" season, should have been inaugurated by the first appearance of Madame Persiani, now at the height of her popularity. But it would seem that for an instant the demon of disaster hovered over Her Majesty's Theatre. Persiani was announced for Tuesday, the 5th April; but, at the last moment, a hand-bill informed the entering crowd that the expected favourite had suffered too much from sea-sickness on her passage from Calais to Dover, to be able to sing. The disappointed public was not to be pacified with a pot pourri from ""Gemma"" and ""Il Giuramento,"" with Guasco and Moltini, but expressed its dissatisfaction with clamour and hissing. The ""check"" was unfortunate to a season destined to realize in many respects the sanguine presages with which it commenced.

In his last solo he imitated the cries of various animals, and suddenly advancing to the foot-lights, caused his violin to bray like an ass, with the exclamation, ""This is for him who hissed"" Instead of laughter, the pit rose in fury, and would have soon made short work of him and his violin, had he not escaped by a back door.

In the evening to the Opera. Venice is the land of late hours: the scene in St. Mark's Place at midnight is more gay and animated than at any hour of the day; and it is after the opera that evening parties and conversazioni commence. The Gondoliers no longer sing the verses of Tasso; but you are frequently regaled with beautiful music from parties of dilettanti musicians. I ought to record, as an instance of the obliging civility of the Italians, that I met a serenading party in a Gondola to-night, singing very beautifully to their guitars the songs of a favourite opera.

The early summer of 1890 was to witness the &nbsp;debut of the successor to Liszt and Rubinstein, of &nbsp;the greatest of the fin de siecle group of great &nbsp;pianists— Ignace Jan Paderewski. This event &nbsp;created interest at the time among a very limited &nbsp;circle. It was anticipated with curiosity only by &nbsp;the critics and dilettanti who follow the trend of &nbsp;musical events in Paris. For several months we &nbsp;had been receiving vivid accounts of a young Polish pianist, “with a wonderful aureole of golden hair,” who executed miracles upon the keyboard, &nbsp;who composed delicious minuets and played Chopin to absolute perfection. But London cares &nbsp;little, as a rule, for what Paris thinks of new artists, and it displayed anything but a burning impatience to hear Leschetizky 's latest pupil. This &nbsp;fact was sufficiently demonstrated by the meagre &nbsp;audience which gathered at St. James 's Hall on the &nbsp;9th of May for the first of the four recitals announced by the composer of “Paderewski 's Minuet”. &nbsp;A more coldly critical assemblage perhaps &nbsp;it would have been impossible to find. Not a &nbsp;soupcon of magnetic current was in the atmosphere—not even the quickened pulse arising from &nbsp;the anticipation of “sensational effects."" &nbsp;&nbsp;When M. Paderewski appeared upon the platform there was a mild round of applause accompanied by an undercurrent of whispering and suppressed murmurs that had evident reference to his &nbsp;unwonted picturesqueness of aspect. The deep &nbsp;golden tinge of his hair seemed to accentuate the &nbsp;intense pallor of his countenance. One could &nbsp;plainly see that he was nervous; but in those deep, &nbsp;thoughtful eyes, in those firmly-set lips, in that &nbsp;determined chin, one could read also the strong, &nbsp;virile qualities of the self-contained, self-reliant &nbsp;artist, already accustomed to conquer audiences &nbsp;and to create magnetism in the most sterile space. &nbsp;Exactly how he played that day— I mean, as compared with the Paderewski whose every mood was &nbsp;by and by to become familiar— it is rather hard &nbsp;for me to say. That he strove to be “sensational” &nbsp;I do not believe now, though at the time it was &nbsp;difficult to think otherwise. For surely his contrasts were startling in their violence, and the instrument fairly thundered under his execution of &nbsp;a forte passage. At times there seemed to be no &nbsp;restraint whatever. His magnificent technique &nbsp;enabled him to give free rein to his impulse and &nbsp;imagination, and laissez aller was then the word. &nbsp;If you loved sensationalism in a pianist, here unquestionably was a virtuoso capable of providing &nbsp;an unlimited quantity of it. &nbsp;And such was the prevailing impression in the &nbsp;minds of the aforesaid critics and dilettanti when &nbsp;they left St. James's Hall that afternoon.&nbsp; ",http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/day/1890-05-09,,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/111f70576fbc8a702139d53538db2c33/1438444845173,Indoor Accompanied Public,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Hermann+Klein/1438157240872,Hermann Klein,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Piano,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Minuet

At each concert some bright particular star appeared as a soloist. I remember a fair-haired girl fragile and apparently with no physique to commend attention on a grand pianoforte in a large room. She came in a light blue muslin dress; sat down hurriedly, and tossed her curls back, looking straight up at the ceiling, whilst her fingers ran quickly in a slight prelude over the keys; then she plunged into a polonaise or something of the kind; it might have been one of poor CHOPIN'S; it probably was, for he was about that time the rage, and quite in the last stage, dying of consumption in London and Scotch drawing-rooms, catching fresh colds every night, faultlessly attired in the miserable dress clothes and exposed shirt-front of the period. General attention had not then been called to his music, but about that time it was beginning to be fashionable in London, which in such matters tardily followed Paris, where CHOPIN had long been adored. I have since been told that MDLLE. CLAUSS afterwards SZAVARDY CLAUSS was cold and mechanical. I only heard her that once, and that was at Willis's Rooms, in, I believe, 1849. We did not think her cold then. From the moment she sat down until she sprang up with that same little flustered, uneasy manner which I noticed on her entrance, our eyes were riveted upon her, and we followed every bar and inflexion of the rapid execution. She seemed to play her piece through as I have sometimes heard RUBINSTEIN without taking breath, and we were forced to hold ours: as the artists sometimes say of a picture, ""It is painted with one brush"" so MDLLE. CLAUSS, never relaxed her mood or her grip; she held her composer and her audience absolutely fast until she had done with both; then she seemed to push both away like one eager to escape.",1849-uu-uu,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/308392212b3c57642df9ea0970c124d6,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/f0662ad4fdba635f9e1c451c772f2bd9/1437644737361,Indoor Public Accompanied,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hugh_Reginald_Haweis,Hugh Reginald Haweis,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Piano,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Polonaise

The change was not greatly to be regretted, for the popularity of Gardoni aided him, and he sang his best. On the morrow, there appeared in all the principal daily prints a long letter from Mr. Sims Beeves, protesting against the interpretation given to his refusal, and asserting that he had only accepted an engagement at Her Majesty's Theatre on the express stipulation that he should be cast for the part of Edgardo in the ""Lucia,"" and other principal tenor parts; and that finding he was not to sing in a forthcoming representation of the first named opera, he considered his contract annulled, and himself at liberty to withdraw. To this communication a firm denial was given in another letter from Mr. Balfe, the conductor, in which that gentleman affirmed that no such stipulation had ever been made — an affirmation he was able to maintain, inasmuch as he himself had signed the contract made with Mr. Reeves; and that moreover the coveted part could not have been promised to him, it having been in the possession of Signor Gardoni six weeks before the engagement of the English vocalist.",http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/day/1848-05-22,,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/e175b188bc7e1fdad28c6dd6b59a839c/1438767762245,Accompanied Indoor Public,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Benjamin+Lumley/1438607277398,Benjamin Lumley,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

I wrote the incidental music for The Medicine Man, a play by Mr. Traill and Robert Hichens, which was produced at the Lyceum, and I saw a good deal of Sir Henry during that time. His kindness and courtesy were unfailing, and it was a real pleasure to have anything to do with him. But oh, what agonies it is to write incidental music for a play! At every instant the orchestra was stopped and some one would say, even if they were playing pianissimo -
“We can’t hear ourselves speak. Please take out all the wind instruments and put mutes on the violins.”
No sooner had this been done than another objection was raised.
“Heavens ! How dull it sounds ! Isn’t something wanting ?”

How beautiful were the tones of that truly grand organ—how sweetly they travelled to my ears from the north transept to the furthest corner of the church, where I was seated! There should always, I think, be an introductory voluntary, whether there is a processional hymn or not. It has, if properly selected, or ably improvised, a calming influence on the mind, which prepares, with dulcet music, the humble worshipper for his subsequent duties.
The sounds of the organ die away, the distant “Amen” after the choristers’ prayer is heard, and the procession of the priests and white-robed choir from the vestry to their stalls in the chancel, is accompanied with a more joyous strain from the organ, which gradually subsides, and the respected vicar, the Rev. G. Hume Smith, then commences to intone the sentences, preces, etc., in a manner which shows at once that you are listening to one who,“with practice severe and tone loud and clear,” has attained to the highest point of chanting power, not to be wondered at when the Vicar’s long connection as Precentor with the Leeds Parish Church is remembered. The Versicles and responses by Tallis were nicely sung by the choir, with the exception of the usual drop in the pitch. The grand old chant in C, of whose authorship we know nothing more than that it is called “ Ancient,” was a right one for Venite, Exultemus, and with hearty and expressive alternate unison and harmony did the choir unto Sing unto the Lord.”
The Psalms (6th day), commencing with the 30th, Exaltabo te, Dotnine (“I will magnify Thee, O Lord”) were sung to the old familiar appropriate double chant in E flat, by Robinson (John, who was organist at Westminster Abbey in 1762), and another by an unknown author. The Psalms throughout, from Monk and Ouseley’s Psalter, were chanted admirably—clearness and distinctness of enunciation, good intonation, and an exactitude of time and ensemble worthy of a cathedral choir. The same may be said of the Te Deum, also given to a double chant, without any change or variety, and this I think might be rectified either by the introduction of specially composed Te Deum chants, or the more easy settings—anthem-wise. A fine, solemn effect was obtained by the singing of the verse “Holy, Holy, Holy!” without organ accompaniment, and in which the sweet female voices of the choir added greatly to the result. The Apostle’s Creed, monotoned with varied organ accompaniment on A, made the pitch rather too high for the subsequent sentences and responses.
The anthem by Stainer, “Jesus said unto his disciples"" sung very nicely, though it presented no particular features of power or interest, was preceded by a much too long introduction on the organ, not reminding one of any particular theme or subject, though serving as a medium for showing the good and varied qualities in the organ. After an excellent rendition of the Litany by the Rev. Percy Stewart (curate) Tours’ Communion Service in F was taken, and here again the clear voice and distinct enunciation of the vicar could be heard in every part of the vast building,—thus proving the advantages of intoning in all large edifices, where otherwise the ordinary mode of reading would be absorbed in echoes and a jumble of words. The composer has cleverly varied his Kyrie Eleison in D by the introduction of the minor key, at the same time preserving something of its original melodic structure. The closing phrase to the words, “And write all these Thy laws in our hearts— We beseech Thee” is extremely devotional and impressive.",187u-Ll-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leeds,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/5a4c74cecb3e461b46359ea30e76c4b1/1470138390872,Accompanied Indoor Public,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Dr+William+Spark/1465384918944,Dr William Spark,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chorale

I had not been up a fortnight when the president of the Cambridge University Musical Society called upon me. He believed I played the violin. ""How did he know that ? ""I asked. He laughed out, ""Everybody in the place knows it."" Then and there he requested me to join the Musical Society, and play a solo at the next concert. I readily agreed, and from that time I became solo violinist at the Cambridge Musical Society, and played a solo at nearly every concert in the Town Hall for the next three years. I confess to some nervousness on my first public appearance at a University Concert. It was a grand night. STERNDALE BENNETT, our new professor of music, himself conducted his ""May Queen” and I think MR. COLERIDGE, an enthusiastic amateur and old musical star at the University, since very well known in London, sang. I had selected as my cheval de bataille, RODE'S air in G with variations, and to my own surprise, when my turn came to go on, I was quite shaky. The hall was crammed, the Master of Trinity sat in the front row with other heads of colleges and their families. I tuned in the ante-room. Someone offered me a glass of wine. I had never resorted to stimulants before playing, but I rashly drank it; it was in my head at once; STERNDALE BENNETT conducted me to the platform. I was a total stranger to the company a freshman in my second month only. My fingers felt limp and unrestrained, my head was half swimming. The crowd looked like a mist. I played with exaggerated expression. I tore the passion to tatters. I trampled on the time. I felt the excess of sentiment was bad, and specially abhorrent to STERNDALE BENNETT, who followed my vagaries like a lamb, bless him for ever! But the thing took. The style was new; at least it was unconventional and probably daring, for I really hardly knew what I was about. The Air was listened to in dead silence, half out of curiosity no doubt; but a burst of applause followed the last die-away notes. I plunged into the variations; I felt my execution slovenly and beneath my usual mark; but I was more than once interrupted by applause, and at the close of the next cantabile movement of extreme beauty, which I played better a sort of meditation on the original air the enthusiasm rose to fever pitch; men stood up in the distant gallery and waved their caps, and I remained holding my violin, unable to proceed with the last rapid variation. When silence was restored I played this atrociously; I hardly played it at all, it was quite wild. STERNDALE BENNETT, seeing that it was all up with me that night, hurried and banged it through anyhow; but the critical faculty of the room was gone, so was my head; I had won by a toss, and although then, and often afterwards, owing to neglect of practice, I was frequently not up to my own mark, my position as solo violinist at the University Concerts was never disputed up to the time that I took my degree.",1859-uu-uu,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/0eea6ec6eed6d8667c0493f0c5098f99,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/6c344f62052d0bd364a0d482e24942b2/1437732424016,Accompanied Indoor Public,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/William+Whewell/1437731002725,William Whewell,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra http://dbpedia.org/resource/Violin,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Air_(music)

We arrived in San Francisco from Australia in the summer of '82, we received a cable message from Mr. Henry E. Abbey, then in London, offering us an engagement to travel the coming season with Madame Christine Nilsson. It was joyfully accepted, and the season was one of the pleasantest we ever passed. We performed on the average three or four times each week, visiting only large cities East and West, and New Orleans and California. The company comprised : Madame Nilsson, soprano; Miss Hope Glen, alto (an American singer who has lived most of her time in London); Mr. Theodore Biorksten, tenor; Signor Del Puente, the well- known baritone; Mr. Charles Pratt, accompanist ; and the Mendelssohn Quintette Club.
Madame Nilsson was in the prime of her vocal powers, and her renditions of the Ah Perfido, Angels ever Bright and Fair, and Connate tu le pays, were examples of great singing. Her chevalde battaille, however, was the “Jewel Song ” from Faust, by Gounod. She used to “ go through all the motions,” just the same as she would in opera. Her ballad singing was a revelation of the fine, tender heart she possessed. It was a rare occasion when she was not forced by popular desire to sing the Suwanee River. She doubtless will be remembered by the great mass of music-lovers as the lady who sang so touchingly about the “old folks at home.",188u-Ee-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/North_America,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/6eb9ccd43e1782cd0f40ee2a011ae11c/1450284094363,Indoor Public Accompanied,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Thomas+Ryan/1448997315048,Thomas Ryan,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tenor http://dbpedia.org/resource/Piano http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baritone http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soprano http://dbpedia.org/resource/Female_vocals http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alto http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chamber_orchestra http://dbpedia.org/resource/Male_vocals,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_music

[…] As soon as it was possible next morning to get ready, I rode down to the plains through a most delightful country, which I cannot pretend to describe in a manner to do it justice. On every side, fruits and flowers rose in clusters, freshened by the morning air: the round heads of the orange-trees glowed with the rays of the sun that was just rising, and darting his beams along the surface of the sea: the whole neighbourhood was enlivened by crowds of men and women singing as they descended the hill to their daily labour.

Considerable curiosity had been excited respecting the new decorations of Her Majesty's Theatre; so that when, on the 3rd of March, the season of 1846 opened, the theatre was crowded in every part. Of these gorgeous, and at the same time tasteful embellishments, a general approval prevailed; whilst the aspect of the vast and elegant interior, in its fresh and magnificent array, struck every eye. Curiosity had been more legitimately, although perhaps less eagerly, excited by the striking novelties which the first night of the season was to produce. The ""Nabucco"" of Verdi, a work which was popular on the Continent, and had in some places caused a perfect furore, was selected to inaugurate the new salle. That Verdi had already made way against his wholesale detractors, was rendered evident by the generally better feeling with which the music of ""Nabucco"" was accepted. In a popular sense, the opera was a decided success; the choral melodies especially suiting the public taste. The libretto, although faulty in many respects, was dramatic, and afforded scope for fine acting and artistic emotion. ""Nabucco,"" in short, floated on the sea of the Anglo-Italian stage, where, whilst one current was always rushing towards novelty, another tended to wreck all novelty whatever in the interests of so-called ""classicism."" Much had been done to place the opera with splendour on the stage, but though it pleased as a whole, no decided success attended the venture of the two new ladies. Sanchioli, wild, vehement, and somewhat coarse, attracted and excited by her ""power, spirit, and fire,"" but she failed to charm. As a ""declaiming, passionate vocalist,"" she created an effect; but the very qualities which had rendered her so popular with an Italian audience, acted somewhat repulsively upon English opera-goers. The lack of refinement in her style was not in their eyes redeemed by the merit of energy. The electric impulse that communicated itself to the Italians, fell comparatively powerless on the British temperament. Sanchioli, however, was in many respects the ""right woman in the right place,"" in this melodramatic opera. The other lady, Mademoiselle Corbari, though destined in after times to please greatly as an altra-prima on the Anglo-Italian stage, and though she was considered from the first, charming, even ""fascinating"" in her simplicity and grace, was not yet acknowledged as a leading vocalist. The nervousness and inexperience of a novice, which she showed at this stage of her career, somewhat lessened the success due to a sweet voice and feeling style, though the prayer allotted to her character, Fenena, was encored nightly. Fornasari pleased those who remained of his old enthusiastic admirers, by his emphatic dramatic action and vigorous declamation, and thus far worked towards the success of Verdi's new opera. It is not unworthy of record that, in compliance with that repugnance which is prevalent in the English mind against any dramatic subject referring however remotely to biblical history, and which had already transformed ""Mose"" into ""Pietro L'Eremita,"" the ""Nabucco"" of the Italian stage was condemned to assume on this occasion an alias under the title of ""Nino Ee D'Assyria."" That the opera thus lost much of its original character, especially in the scene where the captive Israelites became very uninteresting Babylonians, and was thereby shorn of one great element of success, present on the Continent, is undeniable.",http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/day/1846-03-03,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Her_Majesty's_Theatre,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/8d9bec6f740a6bc5bf3f9d82e7735994/1438682176854,Indoor Accompanied Public,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Benjamin+Lumley/1438607277398,Benjamin Lumley,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

The grotesque music given to both Mime and Alberich, like so much of WAGNER'S misunderstood recitative, aims, no doubt, at following the inflections of the human voice as it is affected often by very commonplace moods, as well as by the meaner impulses of arrogance, vexation, anger, and spite. What we lose in musical charm we gain in a certain ingenious sense of reality. I think the power of WAGNER, the solidity of his work, largely turns upon this. He is never afraid of length, of silence, even of dulness, caused by protracted or delayed action. Like DE BALZAC, he knew well how to work up slowly and surely to a consummate effect, and his effect never hangs fire, nor is it ever liable to an anticlimax, that bane of second-rate artists.",1876-08-uu,,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/bfa396a0ef9bc8a978d8aa64506b8e9c/1437994235160,Outdoor Public Accompanied,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hugh_Reginald_Haweis,Hugh Reginald Haweis,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,

The season of 1899 yielded but a single novelty, namely, Isidore de Lara's “Messaline”. True, this was the work of an Englishman; but it was composed to a French libretto and performed by French artists, and it owed its hearing exclusively to foreign influence. Its success, despite the glamour of its picturesque Roman setting, and notwithstanding the art of Heglon, Alvarez, and Renaud, must perforce be described as equivocal. The story at best is revolting; and the music combines with a few fine moments many dull quarts d'heure.",1899-uu-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Covent_Garden,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/459db5934ec6766be0cc206e6810a040/1438598246666,Public Accompanied Indoor,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Hermann+Klein/1438157240872,Hermann Klein,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

The French Opera is the most splendid theatre in Paris; but protect me from French singing!—especially if it be serious singing. Arthur Young, in speaking of French singing, describes it as ""the distortions of embodied dissonance,"" and Rousseau inveighs against the ""lamentable chant Français"" as bearing more resemblance ""aux cris de la colique qu'aux transports des passions;"" and in their choruses there is a grand roar-royal, as if they all had the colic together. The light airs of their comic operas are however very pleasing; and there is at least this merit in their singing, that you can hear what they say. The airs of Gretry are delightful.

The Niebelung's Ring closes with the ""Dusk of the Gods” The truly prodigious way in which all the leading subjects are repeated, inverted and worked up in the music of this last colossal drama cannot be described. The Wotan Melody perhaps the finest blown on trumpets outside the theatre, rang out far over hill and dale, and floated like an ominous blast to the town below. At the familiar sound the people flock to their seats in the theatre. The first melodies of the Rheingold break from the orchestra, and the Norns or Fates are seen weaving the last of their ropes ; they see as they weave the story of Siegfried and Briinnhilde they see the gods growing old they trace the history of Wotan's earth love they start with horror as they at last see the flames rising in a vision round Walhalla.

[Castellan describes a day observing carnival in Florence] 
&nbsp;The spectacle which we ourselves saw was very agreeable. The carriages, which throng the road, give great brilliancy to the scene; they are filled with masks who answer the joy and acclamations of the multitude by throwing them cakes and confetti, and by sprinkling showers of perfumed water from little syringes towards the spectators who line the windows and the balconies: some of the carriages contain musicians, and others are in the shape of triumphal cars, ornamented with different symbols.&nbsp;
I shall only mention one of these masquerades, where luxury was united to good taste, and the contrivance appeared to me new and ingenious: the car, drawn by twelve beautiful horses richly caparisoned, represented Olympus ornamented with foliage, and on which stood the principal heathen deities, surrounded by nymphs and rural gods, and a numerous orchestra. Jupiter occupied the summit of the mountain, seated on the extended wings of an eagle, and enveloped with clouds, whilst Apollo and the Muses were singing and reciting some sonnets, copies of which were thrown amongst the crowd, and in the midst of the deafening noise of the musical instruments Jupiter was perceived to be agitated on his throne of clouds. He shortly leaves the summit of the mountain, rises majestically in the air, and sails along amid the applause of the wondering multitude, on whom he lances his artificial thunder, which, as it falls, changes into serpents; he still ascends, and as the last rays of the sun shine upon him he vanishes from the eyes of the enchanted crowd, who load with prolonged applause the contrivers of a spectacle as splendid as it is ingenious.",17Ll-uu-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Florence,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/9a43fc03e67749d3f841b057a2e11618/1517907784322,Outdoor Accompanied Public,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Antoine+Laurent+Castellan/1517842957331,Antoine-Laurent Castellan,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice http://dbpedia.org/resource/Musical_instrument,

As to his [Plunket Greene] singing, 1 loved it there and then. I love it still. I should love it if he hadn’t a note left in his voice ! but at the time I am speaking of, his voice was lovely. It always touched me inexpressibly. His is the only voice that ever really reminded me of Santley’s; it had the same ring of enthusiasm in it that appealed to me so strongly in the older man. Years ago, at one of his recitals at St. James’s Hall, he sang an old German sacred lullaby in which these words occur -
“O Jesu liebstes Kindelein
Du kleines Kindelein
Wie gross ist doch die Liebe dein
Schleuss in das Herze mein
Die grosse Liebe dein.”
I shall never forget the tenderness with which he sang those lines, the enthusiastic, the beautiful quality of that tenderness. He made you admire what he admired ! He made you love what he loved ! And that day he evoked a vision of the little sacred Child as lovely and as touching as any that has been handed down to us by the great painters of old.
&nbsp;
The day I heard him sing that beautiful old song I had to make a decision, a decision that it cost me a good deal to arrive at. And what helped me to make up my mind to do what I thought bravest and best was the sheer beauty of the Divine Love suggested by his singing, the enthusiastic admiration with which he sang those lines -
“O Jesu liebstes Kindelein
Du kleines Kindelein
Wie gross ist doch die Liebe dein
Schleuss in das Herze mein
Die grosse Liebe dein.”
And as he sang, what seemed an intolerable sacrifice suddenly appeared to me in the light of a great, a unique opportunity of trying for once, at all events, to throw open the doors of my heart in order to allow that Love to enter and take complete possession of it.
Ah, it’s a great thing to be the artist who can make a fellow-creature feel like that !",18uu-uu-uu,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/3b962f54bdc7412b74ef8c5a33f2c358,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/384c5b50780b4e25a8580c701022acc6/1452338272650,Public Indoor Accompanied,http://musicbrainz.org/artist/eca4d562-1e5c-409a-89fa-5489d102cdcb#_,Maude V.

Never have I heard the opening phrase of the 'Inflammatus' in Rossini's 'Stabat Mater' delivered with such magnificent energy and such absolute purity of tone.

Carl Bergmann succeeded Lenschow as conductor [of the Germania Musical Society]. He was a talented composer, and was distinctly a man of great attainments in every line of the art of music. Like Mr. Lenschow, he was a wonderful arranger of musical compositions calculated to win popularity,—an essential thing for all artists who have to work for their bread and butter, among which was a potpourri called Up Broadway that became a great favorite. It was supposed to be a graphic tone-picture of sights and sounds seen and heard from Castle Garden to Union Square, which was at that time the boundary of New York’s bustling life.
This potpourri began with a musical picture of Castle Garden, which was the home, and the only one, good music had at that time in that city. Moving up with the musical diorama, you next came to Barnum’s Museum, with “ Barnum’s Band ” of six or eight brass instruments, which, as all old New Yorkers know, played all day long on a high balcony outside his Museum on Broadway, nearly opposite the Astor House. It was side-splitting to hear the imitation of this brass band. One can even now occasionally enjoy a faint resemblance of it in passing a dime museum.
[…]
Returning to the potpourri, a firemen’s parade with brass band came next Naturally it was preceded by a violent ringing of fire- bells, and a rushing down a side street with “ the machine.” When that noise died away, music from the open door of a dance hall was heard; with of course all its accompaniments, —the rhythm of dancing feet and the calling out of the figures. Then, moving on with the diorama, we passed by a church whence came the sound of organ music and the chanting of a service by a number of voices. After that we heard in the distance a faint kind of Turkish patrol music; then a big crescendo and sudden fortissimo introduced us to Union Square and its life; and two brass bands in two different keys prepared our nerves for the usual collision and fight between two opposing fire companies. This latter made a great sensation. Finally, fireworks were touched off, the Star-Spangled Banner was played, and the potpourri ended, sending every one home in smiling good-humor.

After some unavoidable delay, the season opened on Saturday the 8th March, with the promised opera of ""Ernani."" That it excited the general enthusiasm awarded to it so lavishly in Italy, cannot be asserted; that it was a failure, may be emphatically denied. The general result of this first introduction of Verdi to the English public was a feeling of hesitation and doubt; or as some one drolly said at the time, the ""Well! I don't know's"" had it!” The English are tardy in the appreciation of any kind of novelty, and the reception of Verdi's opera was only in accordance with the national habit. It is well-known that a taste for this composer's music has survived all the opposition of an earlier period, and that he is now generally popular among the musical amateurs in this country. Whatever their intrinsic merits, his operas have achieved a widely-spread success, as pro- vincial theatres and music halls can testify throughout the land; and there can be no doubt that whatever his alleged short-comings in some respects, he has at command passion, fire, and strong dramatic effect.",http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/day/1845-03-08,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Her_Majesty's_Theatre,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/4977c32be8e2d1f3355faa2b8dda4fbd/1438678124494,Accompanied Public Indoor,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Benjamin+Lumley/1438607277398,Benjamin Lumley,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

Signor Costa's ""Don Carlos"" was produced for the eminent conductor's own benefit, on the 20th June. It had been long talked of, long expected, and the musical dilettanti of the day were naturally excited by curiosity as to the result of its production. The ""Malek Adel"" of the same composer, although when it was brought out it attained a certain kind of celebrity (chiefly from the renown of a cavatina sung by Rubini), and was even repeated upon the Italian stage in Paris, had long since disappeared from the boards. Nevertheless considerable expectations were still afloat. ""Don Carlos"" was well ""mounted,"" and supported by Grisi, Mario, Lablache, and Fornasari. Like its predecessor, it utterly failed to maintain any prominence. It survived but a very few nights, and then, like ""Malek Adel,"" sank into the vast ""limbo"" of forgotten works. Whatever may have been the real merit of this production, from a managerial point of view it was undeniably a failure. That is to say, it neither attracted the public nor brought money to the treasury. It is by such tests alone that an operatic or a theatrical director can discover what is and is not conducive to the interest of an establishment. The subject of ""Don Carlos,"" it may be stated, was ""sombre"" and lugubrious, and on the first night, Mario and Lablache were both hoarse, wearied by long rehearsals. This could not be otherwise than detrimental to ""first impressions,"" but the artists gallantly supported their conductor's fame on the second night of performance.",http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/day/1844-06-20,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Her_Majesty's_Theatre,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/4138f025b51cc85e70c29d3e6ddcec14/1438616691267,Indoor Public Accompanied,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Benjamin+Lumley/1438607277398,Benjamin Lumley,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

Such morning concerts are quite common in the larger German cities. An individual, having the means to do it, employs at his own expense an orchestra, or more probably a quartet, or quintet, makes out his own programme, and invites his friends to spend a couple of hours in listening to fine music. On the present occasion, an audience of perhaps two hundred persons (the most musical people of Frankfort) were brought together. Schindler, the biographer of Beethoven, Schmidt the pianist, and other distinguished persons, were present. The concert consisted of both vocal and instrumental music; and Music’s sister, Elocution, was also brought in, and lent her aid in the exercises of the occasion. The programme contained the following pieces (though not in the order in which they are here put down), viz.:— &nbsp;Quintet (G. minor), Mozart, charmingly — I suppose it may be, said, perfectly played by Messrs. Wolff, Baldenecker, Posch, Drinnenberg, and Siedentopf. Quintet Movement, Mozart. This very beautiful movement by Mozart has not before been played since the year 1783. It has been recently discovered in Mozart’s own hand-writing, among his manuscripts, which for some twenty years have been in the family of André of Offenbach. It will shortly be published. Recitative and Air, with violoncello and obligato accompaniment, composed by John Sebastian Bach. This song is quite of a popular character, notwithstanding it is by Bach, reminding one somewhat of Handel’s most popular songs. It is a sacred song, from an unpublished cantate; but the Recitative and Song will soon be published. Part-Songs, for soprano, alto, tenor, and bass. Two songs were sung by a well-trained double quartet. A Poem on Mozart was well read by a lady, having a rich alto voice, Fraulein Gräemann. The effect of introducing this elocutionary exercise was very pleasing, and the example is a good one to be followed wherever a really excellent reader can be found to sustain the part. Strangers are sometimes invited to play in these concerts; and on the present occasion two pianoforte pieces, “Amitie pour amitie,” composed by the performer, and Doneyschock’s Rhapsodie in C. Minor, were played by Mr. William Mason of Boston, U. S.

Teresa [Carrefio ]* made her first appearance in Boston, January 4, 1863. She remained here about one month, and was a great attraction at the grand orchestral concerts which were given at that period under the direction of Carl Zerrahn or P. S. Gilmore. She created a furore of enthusiasm every time she played. I doubt if any child pianist of the same age has ever exceeded her in ability. Imagine a child of nine years playing Thalberg’s Moses, Gottschalk’s Jerusalem, and similar pieces, full of technical difficulties.

The band was in the most perfect order, and the programme was unusually attractive; though great variety of music, both with respect to authorship and character, is always presented to the patrons of this celebrated series of concerts. The Symphonie was by Mozart in Eb major; it is less noisy, flighty and diffuse than some more modem compositions, but not less intelligible or beautiful. The adagio is particularly melodious, elegant and attractive.
A scene and arie from “Orpheus,” by Gluck, followed. Gluck is a decided favorite here, and especially as a dramatic writer stands among the very first.
The third piece was a concerto for violin, by Beethoven, performed by Herr Concertmeister F. David. This concerto, worthy the reputation of its author, was finely rendered by the violinist, and received with a hearty applause. It is very long, but it does not tire for it is full of variety, and there is enough to admire, both in the principal and in the accompaniment. Two quite long cadenzas, composed by the performer, containing each an ingenious recapitulation of the thoughts, or rather allusion to the various figures of the movement in which the cadenza occurred, were introduced, with excellent taste and skill.
The second part of the concert consisted of “Die erste Walpurgisnacht,” a ballad by Goethe, set to music by Mendelssohn. A choir of about one hundred and fifty voices sang the choruses (and there is much chorus in the piece) with admirable promptness and energy. The music is difficult, both for vocalists and instrumentalists; it is one of Mendelssohn’s strong pieces, and is full of his peculiar harmonies. It is mostly very loud, with an abundance of instruments of noise, and extra double drums for earthquake, volcano, and thunder; though there is most acceptable relief in occasional piano passages. Although Mendelssohn does not belong to the noisy school, yet he has shown in the Walpurgisnacht, that if he had chosen to do so he might have cast quite into the shade, or thundered out of existence, all the Verdis of modern times.",1852-03-Mm,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/0a19459865ed69275723d6efb76048c9,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/4ffc18efd98db99a3421b4f80aee2f23/1448285803274,Accompanied Public Indoor,http://musicbrainz.org/artist/f422b99a-b48c-4bee-bc0c-f2e8cad82b6c#_,Dr. Lowell Mason Lowell Mason,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Violin http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Concerto

In the evening I attended one of the numerous concerts given in the charming gardens which are to be found in the environs of Hamburg. We had a performance by three military bands, numbering 120 players; they played separately and unitedly, the balance of tone being in both instances remarkably even and good. Amongst other pieces Wagner’s well-known March in Tannhaiiser was played by the united bands, where, at the passage of quavers in the bass towards the end of the composition, the combined brass instruments produced a stupendous effect. Individually, too, these bands executed both classical and popular music with a care, earnestness, and spirit which showed how much personal artistic interest the different performers took in the delightful work they had in hand.",1870-Mm-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hamburg,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/d6a48b875c228bc55c25b5e3ad25d6fa/1465385129990,Public Accompanied Outdoor,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Dr+William+Spark/1465384918944,Dr William Spark,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brass,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Martial_music

They are held in a somewhat smaller room, and at a small subscription price, and are given only once in two weeks. The orchestra consists of about sixty talented musicians, and if Dreyschock and David are not seen leading the violins here as at the Gewandhaus, they, together with the other instruments, string and wind, are in the hands of artists of deservedly high reputation. The selections are also of the highest order, and the Euterpe presents its patrons with the works of the great masters in a style worthy of a Leipzig concert.
At a quarter of an hour before the time of commencement, the members of the orchestra were in their places, talking, tuning and getting ready. This, together with the general conversation of the people assembled, produces a buzzing chorus of great power — a chorus with which the Leipzig concerts commence. Every ticket was sold at an early hour, and of course every seat was occupied.
The concert commenced precisely at the hour appointed, with a new Sinfonie in E flat Major, in manuscript, by W. Westmayer, who conducted the performance. He is a young candidate for fame, who has been educated at the Conservatory here, and who is regarded as already a successful composer. The Sinfonie consisted of four parts, and occupied in its performance exactly thirty-eight minutes. I dare not attempt anything like a particular description of it, or comparison of it with other like compositions; it was listened to with good attention by a discriminating audience, and met a favorable reception. It seemed to me, however, to want light and shade, and variety in the treatment of the different subjects introduced. Parts of it were exceedingly interesting, considered in reference to modern combinations and contrasts of the different orchestral elements, but there was a too constant forte, and a too frequent reiteration of the tonic and dominant harmony, with brass instruments, in military rhythm — this, indeed, is a general resort of such composers as are sometimes at a loss for an idea, or in a similar condition with the public speaker who is obliged to speak, but has nothing in particular to say. I do not mean that Mr. Westmayer was minus thought, but still there was not such a flow as we often find in a Mozart.
The Sinfonie was truly good, and seemed to give much satisfaction — and yet I could not help thinking that it was an excellent preparation for the high appreciation of the next orchestral piece, which was no less an overture than the celebrated No. 2, C Major, to Leonore, and which was given with an effect far beyond what can be often heard.
The overture by C. M. Von Weber, to Oberon, was also played with such an energy and brilliancy as to take one’s breath away. The stillness of the pianos, the gradual and immense range of the crescendos, the thundering power of the fortes, with instantaneous contrasts and startling sfortzandos, were enough to work up the feelings to a perfect phrenzy. Wonderfully effective were these ever favorite overtures by Beethoven and Weber.
It was no small attraction of this concert that the piano forte was played by the Fraulein Maria Wieck, the sister of the celebrated Clara, wife of Robert Schumann. Mdlle. Wieck is a very superior player; she has not the strong hand of a DeMeyer or a Listz, but she has a most finished touch, and plays with great elegance and expression. Her first piece (hear it, oh ye of the exclusive modern school,) was nothing more nor less than Dussek’s 12th Concerto in E fiat major, the Adagio and Allegro movements of which she played — a most beautiful composition, elegant and tasteful in the highest degree, played both by the principal and by the orchestra as near perfection as such things can be done. There is nothing in the music to astonish, or to excite wonder or surprise, but there is that in it which is adapted to call forth perfect delight. It is full of peace, and innocence, and purity, and joy, and it is from beginning to end a constant appeal to the perception of the beautiful. I am no enemy to the modem school; it is indispensable to an accomplished pianist, and every well-educated musician will delight in it; but they err who suppose that in Clementi and Cramer and Dussek and Pleyel, there is nothing good or worth being saved. The fact is, the pianists, previous to him who is generally regarded as the head of the great modern school, had worked out a very satisfactory solution of the problem of piano forte playing, or certainly so if considered with reference to the more natural and legitimate powers of the instrument. Thaiberg, Listz, and others, have certainly much enlarged the boundaries, or the available capacities of the piano, but some of their followers have gone to extremes; so much so that there has seemed to be danger of losing altogether the ordinary effects of piano forte playing, or that they would he swallowed up in the extraordinary feats of left-hand melodies, flights of octaves, and the various methods by which amazement and wonder are excited. Thanks for the signs of returning soberness and good sense; we greatly mistake if other authors like Dussek are not yet to be brought back to the concert room, and to the parlor, to fill with delight the spirit of the true lover of music, and of the most beautiful of all keyed instruments, the piano forte.
A word to another class. There are some who condemn altogether the modern school, and who seem to suppose that all true musical genius left the world with Haydn and those of his day. Fraulein Wieck is not of their number, for while she played Dussek, in the first part of the concert, she played not Thalberg, or Listz, or DeMeyer in the second part, but Pagannini! Yes, the Carnival of Venice, arranged for the piano, and if music pleased legitimately in Dussek, the Fraulein excited no small degree of feeling by her exquisite touch, and facility of execution in the composition of the Prince of violinists. What if it be mere trickery; a dexterous artifice will always, at least, call forth admiration, and one does not always want to sit in sober judgment; and decide on the grounds of intrinsic musical merit — relaxation must be indulged, the beautiful give way to the ornamental, and true pleasure to mere amusement. If there is a time for all things, surely there is room enough for the old and new school of piano forte playing — yes, and for both schools of organ playing too, although this is not the place to dwell upon the latter.
There was still another interesting feature in the Euterpe&nbsp;Concert — it was the singing of Mdlle. Louise Wolfl. She sang an air from Stradella by Flotow, and also two German songs, the latter by Franz Schubert. A pretty singer, but not superior to several American vocalists.",1852-01-Mm,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leipzig,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/7d046dd6ed39201069867d63d09c539d/1448277075075,Public Accompanied Indoor,http://musicbrainz.org/artist/f422b99a-b48c-4bee-bc0c-f2e8cad82b6c#_,Dr. Lowell Mason Lowell Mason,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Female_vocals,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aria

Music was almost entirely neglected during my years at Miss Reach’s. I had no lessons, but was sent to practise by myself for an hour every afternoon on a horrid little upright piano in the dreary dining-room.
&nbsp;
Of course I did nothing of the sort; in the first place, I had nothing to practise, for I certainly had no intention of learning any of the really dreadful drawing-room pieces with which the piano was covered. Occasionally I played through one of them, for I read music quite easily. How I jibbed at the “Prière d’une Vierge”! The “Gems of Scotland,” set in arpeggios and triplets, were sham jewels for which I had unmitigated contempt, and one or two pieces by Brinsley Richards made my flesh creep. I had such frightful attacks of low spirits in that dreary back room that I never think of it without horror. After some months I began to connect music itself with those four walls and those hideous tenth-rate compositions which lay in bilious green and yellow covers on the top of the piano, and it seemed to me that my own love of music was being slowly poisoned to death. So much for atmosphere! When I left Miss Reach’s at the end of the year, I would not have cared if I had never set eyes on a piano again. I almost hated the sight of one. Something lovely in me had died.

A few kind lines on the evening of reaching Albano announced to his wife his having 'walked to Ariccia,' though 'the way was painful' (the scenes being associated with the illness and death of the beloved child), and arranged with Schnorr to go the next day to Monte Cavo, and the following to Cori, begging anxiously to hear from her.

On a certain afternoon there was neither solo pianist nor violinist down on the programme, but a player on the contre-basso was to occupy the vacant place. I remember my disappointment. Who is that tall, sallow-looking creature with black moustache and straight hair, with long bony fingers, yet withal a comely hand, who comes lugging a great double-bass with him? Someone might have lifted it up for him ; but no, he carries it him- self and hoists it lovingly on to the platform. He seems familiar with its ways, and will allow no one to help him. Why, there are SAINTON, HILL, PIATTI, and COOPER, all coming on without their fiddles. They seem vastly interested in this ungainly couple - the man and the big bass. He has no music. People behind me are standing up to get a better sight of him, although he is tall enough in all conscience. I had better stand up too ; they are standing up in front of me, I shall see nothing ! so I stood on a chair. The first curiosity over, we all sat down, and, expecting little but a series of grunts, were astonished at the outset at the ethereal notes lightly touched on the three thick strings, harmonics of course, just for tuning. But all seemed exquisitely in tune with the piano. This man was BOTTESINI, then the latest novelty. How he bewildered us by playing all sorts of melodies in flute-like harmonics, as though he had a hundred nightingales caged in his double-bass! Where he got his harmonic sequences from; how he hit the exact place with his long, sensitive, ivory-looking fingers; how he swarmed up and down the finger-board, holding it round the neck at times with the grip of a giant, then, after eliciting a grumble of musical thunder, darting up to the top and down again, with an expression on his face that never seemed to alter, and his face always calmly and rather grimly surveying the audience; how his bow moved with the rapidity of lightning, and his fingers seemed, like Miss Kilmansegg's leg, to be a judicious com- pound of clockwork and steam: all this, and more, is now a matter of musical history, but it was new then. I heard him play the ""Carnival de Venice”.",1849-uu-uu,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/308392212b3c57642df9ea0970c124d6,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/2d137328c4020e14a095d7fcd0684857/1437669986042,Indoor Public Accompanied,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hugh_Reginald_Haweis,Hugh Reginald Haweis,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Double_bass,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Solo_(music)

Public performances by some one of them are very frequent; so frequent indeed, that we can find time for only now and then one. The first for the season was by the ""Sacred Harmonic Society,"" under Mr. Costa, and consisted of a selection from ""Samson,"" by Handel, Mendelssohn's ""Christus,"" ""The Last Judgment,"" by Spohr. The death of the illustrious Duke gave a tinge to all the earlier concerts, and the ""Dead March"" in Saul was in constant requisition. On the present occasion, the selection from ""Samson"" consisted of the air, ""Ye Sons of Israel,"" ""Dead March,"" and chorus,&nbsp;
""Glorious hero, may thy grave&nbsp;Peace and honor ever have.""&nbsp;
The ""Christus"" by Mendelssohn, seems to be very popular, both among the singers and hearers. The chorale, ""As bright the Star of Morning gleams,"" one of the best German chorales, and one that is very often heard in their churches, is brought in with fine effect after the chorus, ""There shall a Star of Jacob&nbsp;come forth."" Mendelssohn is always great in such choruses as ""He stirreth up the Jews,"" ""Crucify Him,"" and others in which he depends mostly upon orchestral effect, and in which he carries out his ideas of imitation or description with all the powers of modem instrumentation.&nbsp;
Spohr's oratorio was well given, the Gresham Professor himself being judge; for we had the honor of a seat by his side, and of listening to his remarks during the perormance. Mr. Taylor was the first to bring out Spohr in England. ""Die letzten Dinge,"" or ""The Last Things,"" (which is a much better title for the oratorio than the one it now bears,) was composed about twenty-five years ago. It accidently came into the hands of Prof. Taylor, who translated the words, and first brought it out at the Norwich Festival in 1830. Since then it has been a standard oratorio, and is often performed. Prof. Taylor says: ""It at once seized the public attention, and commanded the admiration of the most distinguished professors of every school. Its influences upon the feelings of an audience has been attested by expressions more decided and unequivocal than I ever remember to have witnessed. I speak not of the admiration which the musician derives from such a display of the power and the resources of his art, but of the homage which nature, though musically untutored, involuntarily yet willingly pays to genius. The throbbing heart, the moistening eye, the quivering lip, here bespeak the triumph of the composer."" The solo parts&nbsp;were sustained by Mrs. Endersohn, Miss Williams, Mr. Lockey and Mr. Phillips.&nbsp;
We cannot enter into the detail of this performance; suffice it to say, that it afforded some of the best specimens of solo, quartet and chorus singing which we have ever heard. It was&nbsp;performed with admirable promptitude and exactness, as is everything else that is brought under the bâton of Mr. Costa.",http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/day/1853-01-11,http://dbpedia.org/resource/London,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/3c48dad6e349238e38ccce550b46979b/1461779488309,Accompanied Public Indoor,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Edward+Taylor/1461779056247 http://musicbrainz.org/artist/f422b99a-b48c-4bee-bc0c-f2e8cad82b6c#_,Edward Taylor Dr. Lowell Mason Lowell Mason,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra http://dbpedia.org/resource/Choir http://dbpedia.org/resource/Female_vocals http://dbpedia.org/resource/Male_vocals,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oratorio

It is not indeed a new hall, but an old one repaired, painted, and ornamented; it is in the same house where Bach lived, and is the very room where Bach, Hiller and others labored and conducted musical performances. Hauptmann now occupies the same apartments which were formerly occupied by the great Fuguist. The exercises, with the exception of a short address by one of the pupils, were exclusively musical, as follows:
I. Prayer. ""Kommet Lasset uns anbeten"", Hauptmann
II. Motette. ""Der Geist hilft unserer Schwachheit, J.S. Bach
III. Four part-songs:-
1. ""O Thaeler weit, o Hoehen"", Mendelssohn
2. ""O sanfter, suesser Hauch"", Mendelssohn
(The above may be found in the ""Social Glee Book,"" and have been sung in the Boston Musical Conventions.)
3. ""Waldeinsamkeit"", Hauptmann
4. ""Ich stand auf, Berges Hoehen"", Hauptmann
IV. Motette. ""Jauchzet dem Herrn"", Schicht.
The singing was by the choir of the school and church, which consisted of about fifty voices; Soprano and Alto by boys. It was entirely without accompaniment. A grand Pianoforte in the room was only used to announce the pitch before each piece.
[... H]ere is a chorus who stand up and sing Bach’s and other most difficult motets, the most difficult vocal music perhaps ever written, by voices alone, with as much certainty as the sure aim of an experienced marksman.
I think I have never before witnessed such devotion to the work as in these singers. Here is indeed entire self-committal. Every one throws all the powers he has, physical and spiritual, into the performance of the music. Every tone is attacked with a conscious certainty of success; no matter how complicated the rhythm, it is given with an energy and truthfulness that a first-rate violinist can hardly excel. The singers seem to have a perfect command of their vocal organs, and are no less certain of results than is the accomplished pianist when he strikes the keys, or the violinist when he draws the bow. There is an entire absence of that sleepiness, drowsiness, inattention, and foolish levity too often witnessed in our choirs. No looking about, or whispering, or laughing, or silliness; but close attention is ever manifested. I wish I had words to point out that consecration to the work, that deep, heartfelt interest which these choir members seem to possess; so that it might be sought for by our American singers. [...] I have never before heard a vocal chorus so prompt, so energetic, and perfect in time and tune, as on this occasion. The place, too, was holy ground, for all the great musicians have visited that saloon; Bach lived there as his home, and Handel, and Haydn, and Mozart, and Beethoven have been there. A new portrait of Bach (or rather an old one put in perfect order) has been placed at the head of the hall, and opposite to it is a fine bust of Schicht, who, though less known, was a very profound musician, as his works testify. On the whole, I have not attended a more interesting musical performance in Germany.

Mr. B. J. Lang, the almost lifelong organist and steadfast helper of the Handel and Haydn Society, and for a time the successor of Carl Zerrahn as conductor, has shown in countless ways such consummate skill, tact, and artistic judgment that he has won the admiration of all musicians. […]&nbsp; While still very young he organized, in 1862, a couple of concerts, in which he appeared as the conductor of a large orchestra, chorus, and soloists, in two performances of the Walpurgis Nacht. He thus entered upon a broad, artistic life, and has continued in the same path. He has been the conductor of the Apollo Club since its formation in 1871, and also of the St. Cecilia Club. The first concert of the latter was given November 19, 1874, orchestra assisting. The programme consisted of several part-songs and the Walpurgis Nacht, by Mendelssohn.",http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/day/1874-11-19,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boston,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/48c14572733bcdcfbf8991c396ab4107/1450211021118,Accompanied Public Indoor,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Thomas+Ryan/1448997315048,Thomas Ryan,Performance,,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_music

2. Recitation. Poetry in honor of the King of Prussia. Read by, Herr Herchenbach.
3. Psalm fur Männerchor mit Solo, C. Schanabel.
4. Scene and Arie from “Faust” Sung by Frl. Sophie Schloss, Spohr.
5. Concerto (E flat major) for Piano Forte with Orchestra. Performed by Madame Clara Schumann, Beethoven.
6. “Meebestille,“ “Männerchor” with Orchestra. Composed by Capellmeister Fischer.

SECOND PART.
7. Overture to Shakspeare’s “Julius Caesar.”, R. Schumann.
8. Arie from “Fidelio.” Sung by Frl. Mathilde Hartmann, Beethoven.
9. Variations on a theme from “Preciosa,” with orchestra accompaniment. Performed by Mad’le Wieck and Mad. Clara Schumann, Weber.
10. “Bacchuschor” for Männerchor, with orchestra, from “Antigone,” by Mendelssohn.
11. “Saltarello,” S. Heller.“Notturno,” F. Chopin.“Lied Ohne Worte,” Mendelssohn.For the Piano Forte. Performed by Mad. Clara Schumann.
12. Finale. Full Chorus, Männerchor, with orchestra. By Julius Rietz.

The former took their places in the orchestra, but the solo singers came into the body of the Hall. This gave us a fine opportunity of seeing them all, and of shaking hands with some of them.
[...]
The rehearsal commenced at 11 o’clock, and (with the exception of the necessary intermission for refreshments) continued until nearly 12 at night. Such pieces only were taken up as were new, or not generally known. A part of Samson, a new posthumous motette by Mendelssohn, his fragment of an oratorio, Christus, and also of
Lorelie. Beethoven’s great 9th, and various other pieces belonging to the evening performances, were more or less rehearsed. Beethoven’s Choral Symphony occupied about two hours. It was evidently the piece for the success of which Mr. Costa felt the greatest anxiety — since it is the most difficult composition on the programme; and he spared no effort to make its performance perfect. It was originally written for the London Philharmonic Society; but it was not performed with any success until long after its production.
This rehearsal-day was full of interest and instruction, and afforded us an opportunity of standing a little behind the curtain, and of seeing something more of the principal vocalists than we otherwise could have done. Though tedious, the result was satisfactory; and when it was nearly 12 o’clock, and the company parted, there seemed to be a general assurance of a successful performance on the morrow.",1852-09-Ee,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/67819eec730342e5a7cbb6aa92af696e,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/7e15623c3b915c7007d8df1789f14029/1448922389560,Accompanied Domestic Indoor,http://musicbrainz.org/artist/f422b99a-b48c-4bee-bc0c-f2e8cad82b6c#_,Dr. Lowell Mason Lowell Mason,Performance,,

How beautiful were the tones of that truly grand organ—how sweetly they travelled to my ears from the north transept to the furthest corner of the church, where I was seated! There should always, I think, be an introductory voluntary, whether there is a processional hymn or not. It has, if properly selected, or ably improvised, a calming influence on the mind, which prepares, with dulcet music, the humble worshipper for his subsequent duties.
The sounds of the organ die away, the distant “Amen” after the choristers’ prayer is heard, and the procession of the priests and white-robed choir from the vestry to their stalls in the chancel, is accompanied with a more joyous strain from the organ, which gradually subsides, and the respected vicar, the Rev. G. Hume Smith, then commences to intone the sentences, preces, etc., in a manner which shows at once that you are listening to one who,“with practice severe and tone loud and clear,” has attained to the highest point of chanting power, not to be wondered at when the Vicar’s long connection as Precentor with the Leeds Parish Church is remembered. The Versicles and responses by Tallis were nicely sung by the choir, with the exception of the usual drop in the pitch. The grand old chant in C, of whose authorship we know nothing more than that it is called “ Ancient,” was a right one for Venite, Exultemus, and with hearty and expressive alternate unison and harmony did the choir unto Sing unto the Lord.”
The Psalms (6th day), commencing with the 30th, Exaltabo te, Dotnine (“I will magnify Thee, O Lord”) were sung to the old familiar appropriate double chant in E flat, by Robinson (John, who was organist at Westminster Abbey in 1762), and another by an unknown author. The Psalms throughout, from Monk and Ouseley’s Psalter, were chanted admirably—clearness and distinctness of enunciation, good intonation, and an exactitude of time and ensemble worthy of a cathedral choir. The same may be said of the Te Deum, also given to a double chant, without any change or variety, and this I think might be rectified either by the introduction of specially composed Te Deum chants, or the more easy settings—anthem-wise. A fine, solemn effect was obtained by the singing of the verse “Holy, Holy, Holy!” without organ accompaniment, and in which the sweet female voices of the choir added greatly to the result. The Apostle’s Creed, monotoned with varied organ accompaniment on A, made the pitch rather too high for the subsequent sentences and responses.
The anthem by Stainer, “Jesus said unto his disciples"" sung very nicely, though it presented no particular features of power or interest, was preceded by a much too long introduction on the organ, not reminding one of any particular theme or subject, though serving as a medium for showing the good and varied qualities in the organ. After an excellent rendition of the Litany by the Rev. Percy Stewart (curate) Tours’ Communion Service in F was taken, and here again the clear voice and distinct enunciation of the vicar could be heard in every part of the vast building,—thus proving the advantages of intoning in all large edifices, where otherwise the ordinary mode of reading would be absorbed in echoes and a jumble of words. The composer has cleverly varied his Kyrie Eleison in D by the introduction of the minor key, at the same time preserving something of its original melodic structure. The closing phrase to the words, “And write all these Thy laws in our hearts— We beseech Thee” is extremely devotional and impressive.",187u-Ll-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leeds,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/70c5273b2e8611f1bea07381aaa693f5/1469630403248,Accompanied Indoor Public,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Dr+William+Spark/1465384918944,Dr William Spark,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Female_vocals http://dbpedia.org/resource/Male_vocals,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chorale

On his return to town in the evening, he attended a reception given in his honor at the Grosvenor Gallery by Walter Bache. This was in some respects the most striking function of the series. The gathering was in every sense a representative one, and the famous abbe, as he went round chatting from group to group, seemed positively radiant with happiness. To repeat his own words, addressed to myself: “You have so overwhelmed me with kindness in this country that I shall be quite sorry when the time comes for me to leave you.” The programme comprised his “Angelus” for strings, a chorus for female voices, a pianoforte piece, and some songs; and finally, amid a scene of great excitement, he himself played the finale of Schubert's “Divertissement a la Hongroise” and his own Hungarian rhapsody in A minor. This glorious treat furnished the crowning feature of a memorable evening— doubly memorable because it was the last time but one that Franz Liszt touched his instrument in the presence of a public or quasi-public assemblage.",http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/day/1886-04-08,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/8846cca4a0345e0b412424b32ec881c4,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/a022d80a0800bf05b268def49aed2ee0/1438263474031,Accompanied Indoor Domestic,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Hermann+Klein/1438157240872,Hermann Klein,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Piano,

The conductor was Robert Schumann himself; the pianist was his wife. The orchestra was large, and the best that Leipzig could furnish. Robert Schumann has great celebrity, and especially in those cities where he has resided and has brought out his music under his own immediate direction. No one since Mendelssohn’s death stands so high in the estimation of the German musicians. There are places where he is not known, because his music is not understood; but even in these, and throughout Germany, he is regarded as standing at the very head of his profession, and no one commands aa. he does the universal attention of scientific men. Some go so far as to regard him as the greatest symphonist that has ever lived; but time can only determine this.
The concert had been advertised for some time, and the expectations of the lovers of music were fully awake. Not only were the musicians and lovers of music of Leipzig present, but literary and scientific men of the various professions, and the beauty, and wealth, and fashion of the city came to do homage to talent of so high an order, and to learning so extensive. Like the people at Lystra, so here, they lifted up their voices, saying, not in the speech of Lycaonia, but in that of Saxony ""The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men.”&nbsp;
[...]
But it was not only from this city that the audience was gathered on this occasion; it had been noised abroad that this concert was to be given, and musical men of high standing, Kapellmeisters and Concertmeisters, from the region round about, came up to Leipzig. Berlin, Dresden, Weimar, and other places were represented. At the head of this foreign company, and indeed at the head of the whole company, was Lis[zt];— the very Lis[zt] himself came from Weimar to listen, and to pay honor to greatness. But Robert Schumann is not alone, he has a “help meet” indeed. Clara Wieck was perhaps the most distinguished female pianist who has ever lived; and, unlike many ladies, she did not give up her instrument when she became Clara Schumann, but rather devoted herself with greater assiduousness under her new instructor, than she had previously done under the teachings of her father, to the profession which had been the choice of both her husband and herself. No wonder that the people should assemble on the occasion of a visit from this far-famed couple. But they came not to hear any one sing or play on an instrument, for although the wife is indeed a most accomplished pianist, yet the husband neither plays nor sings; but they rather came to hear the new music that the master had produced. They looked for some new musical revelation, for new chords (if possible), or new progressions; at least some new method of treatment, or harmonic development was expected. It was not to be the same tune over again. They went away satisfied; for, not only was the musical performance pronounced to be one of the very best, but the music, or the principal piece of attraction, was regarded as worthy of its author.
The first piece was the “Overture zu L. Byron's Manfred&nbsp;von R. Schumann,"" This is an overture in the true learned German style, and as unlike the overtures of the modem Italian and French schools as can be imagined; of course, it cannot be popular, that is, it cannot take with the people generally; on this occasion, however, it was fully appreciated and listened to, by one of the most intelligent musical audiences that could be brought together in Germany, with unmingled delight. The second piece was “Concert No. 2, F moll, fur Piano Forte mit Begleitung des or Chester, von F. Chopin,” performed by Clara Schumann. This is said to be in Chopin’s peculiar style, and one of his most difficult productions. Mad. Schumann played it with apparent ease, and with a delicacy of touch and distinctness of articulation not to be excelled. She has not so great a power as some; in this respect she resembles Chopin himself, but in everything else requisite to the perfection of piano forte playing she is fully accomplished. The third piece was a song by Herr Behr, necessary for variety’s sake; after which Mad. Schumann played most charmingly two pieces- “Andantino von W. Sterndale Bennett"" and ""Lied ohne Worte (F major), von F. Mendelssohn Bartholdy.”
The second part of the concert (and here was the attraction) consisted of “Die Pilgerfahrt der Rose” (the pilgrimage of the rose), a new composition for voices (solo and chorus) and orchestra by Robert Schumann. This has been performed here a week or two before, and was noticed in a previous communication. Anything like an analytical notice of it from one who has heard it but once or twice would hardly be expected, and in the present case it would be quite absurd. It will be known in a few years. The orchestra never played better; the idea of playing under Schumann inspired every man with new life and energy, and the improvement in the performance of the music under the direction of the composer (there having been a previous rehearsal also under his teaching), was said to be very apparent. We can hardly imagine a musical occasion that would be more interesting or exciting especially to the truly enlightened musician than this. For the few details here given we are indebted to others, for we did not attend this concert; we neither saw the sight nor heard the sound thereof. Why? It was given on Sunday Morning, March 14th, at 11 o'clock.",http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/day/1852-03-14,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/0a19459865ed69275723d6efb76048c9,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/1e8555f7d6fd6f5ecacd6bfa76ad30f8/1448285235765,Accompanied Indoor Public,http://musicbrainz.org/artist/f422b99a-b48c-4bee-bc0c-f2e8cad82b6c#_ http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Franz+Liszt/1424794451085,Dr. Lowell Mason Lowell Mason Franz Liszt,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Piano,

The first time I remember really appreciating music was on one winter afternoon. I was alone in the sitting-room, trying to do my lessons, perched up on my favourite window-seat. In reality I was listening to the trio my governess was playing in the next room with a violinist and ’cello player, friends of hers, who used sometimes to come over from Mannheim to make music with her. I don’t know what they were playing,—it was probably something classical,—but it began to affect me very strangely. I felt horribly sad, but I wasn’t crying. I was simply longing for something, but I didn’t know what. After a while they left off playing, and Mel came into the sitting-room to see what I was doing. Evidently I didn’t look quite normal, for she asked me what was the matter. I said in a choking voice, “ I think I have a sore throat.” I hadn’t a sore throat, but it was the first time I had ever had a lump in my throat, and I didn’t know what it meant then.

The orchestra of the Royal Opera House is of course excellent, and ranks with the best in Europe. Yet we did not see that it was much superior to that of the Leipzig Gewandhaus. It is somewhat larger, and its pianos are, perhaps, more piano, and its fortes more forte. The great points of excellence, as quality of tone, blending of the different instruments, Piano, Forte, Crescendo, Diminuendo, Sfortzando, Syncopation, &amp;c., are most perfectly brought out, and the most fastidious hearer seems to be compelled to say, enough.",1852-04-Ee,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/cd151e4c0cf8b031d64daad7425e51b5,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/88a9e0eea6c895faabba21e4dc583c21/1448312342380,Indoor Public Accompanied,http://musicbrainz.org/artist/f422b99a-b48c-4bee-bc0c-f2e8cad82b6c#_,Dr. Lowell Mason Lowell Mason,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Overture

Tickets were sold at five dollars each. Large amounts were also received from premiums, and there was realized from that first concert thirty-five thousand dollars—official record.
Does not the above read like exaggerated nonsense ? Nevertheless, it is true history.
In 1850 there was no concert-room of decent size uptown in New York, and Mr. P. T. Bamum was allowed to alter the interior of Castle Garden in such a manner as to fit it for his purpose. It was made large enough to hold between six and seven thousand persons, the old circular form being retained.
Probably a year in advance of Jenny Lind’s advent in America, Mr. Barnum began to prepare the American people to properly receive “the musical saint,” “the second Santa Cae cilia,” “ the angel of the stage,” "" the most wonderful singer ever listened to by mortal ears,” etc.
[...]
The result was that the public was made to believe that saints and angels were nowhere in comparison with Jenny Lind, and that a hearing of her singing of I Know that my Redeemer Liveth was quite evangelizing in its effect.
She did sing it grandly, and with a fervor which satisfied every musician. Handel himself would have gone down on his knees to thank her for a true, devotional, musician-like performance of that fine song.",185u-uu-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/New_York_City,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/f0ee4fb075bdd5b250093359d39f3a41/1450268637034,Public Accompanied Indoor,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Thomas+Ryan/1448997315048,Thomas Ryan,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soprano http://dbpedia.org/resource/Female_vocals,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chorale

Interest was keenly excited by the production at Her Majesty's, in July, 1880, of Boito's “Mefistofele."" The work had been much talked of since its revival, in revised form, at Bologna in 1875, and Mr. Mapleson took creditable pams to mount it in such fashion that there should be few looijholes for criticism. Truth to tell, it was an exceedingly good representation all round. Christine Nilsson's embodiment of the dual role of Margherita and Helen of Troy had much of poetry and charm; Trebelli was as fascinating and artistic as ever in the contralto parts; Campanini made an excellent Faust; and Nannetti lent rare sardonic color and alertness to the part of Mefistofele, Sir Michael Costa was still vigorous enough to conduct Boito's opera in his old resolute, vigilant manner; and very delighted he was over its success, which lent quite a special distinction to the season.",1880-07-uu,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/efdd01e256923e4b69230e1f1a023076,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/923ce3bb0f355287c400db380e4cdc88/1438259723531,Public Indoor Accompanied,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Hermann+Klein/1438157240872,Hermann Klein,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

Sims Reeves in the original instance was an opera-singer. I once heard him in opera, but he was then nearly sixty, and had long abandoned his stage career. I first heard him sing at the Norwich Festival of 1866, when he took part in Costa's oratorio “Naaman”. His voice was then still in its prime. A more exquisite illustration of what is termed the true Italian tenor quality it would be impossible to imagine; and this delicious sweetness, this rare combination of “velvety” richness with ringing timbre, he retained in diminishing volume almost to the last.",1866-uu-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Norwich,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/8c6ac0e293acd6d76242dd805b715e20/1438599802842,Public Indoor Accompanied,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Hermann+Klein/1438157240872,Hermann Klein,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oratorio

The organ has lately received an addition of pedal pipes of the largest size, descending an octave below the original notes. These, under the gigantic tread of Cooper, have conferred a grandeur upon the instrument never surpassed. Fortunately, the anthem was one of all others I wished to hear, that celebrated production of Dr. Blow, ' I was in the spirit on the Lord's day.'

There was no processional hymn, the organist playing, whilst the clergy and choir took their places, a soft voluntary by Archer. The confession was monotoned throughout, the more modern pretty cadences, which were permitted to be sung for some years, being now, happily, excluded. The whole of the versicles, etc., were the beautiful and time-honoured work of Tallis. The Venite was sung to a single chant by Nares, and the Psalms for the day to a double chant in A minor and major by Battishill. I very much doubt if the major adaptation of this chant was written by Battishill, any more than was the chord of the six-four preceding the tonic at the end of the second phrase. A fine effect has always been obtained at the Parish Church by the basses alone giving out, in impressive unison, the first half of the chant, the second half being followed by the full choir. It might, perhaps, have been an improvement if there had been a little more variety of expression and power in the chanting of the Psalms, in every verse of which there lies a u point to seize,” and the perception of this point will give a feeling in the rendition which will be taken as coming from the heart, although, in fact, it may be only from the lips. The choir, I venture to think, stand as precentors to the congregation, and their delivery of the poetry of the Psalms will govern the delivery of the congregation. Every syllable should be distinctly uttered—no gabble, no hurry. It would be as well that every church choir should have a master in this phonic science, in order that the Psalms shall be chanted in rythmical rule—every verse, in fact, marked out as to its harmonious form in language. I need not say how gratifying it was to me to hear the service of my lifelong friend, the late Henry Smart, sung with such power and expression. Of this work I may perhaps be permitted to repeat, what I have said elsewhere, that it is agreed by the most eminent church musicians there is nothing more complete or beautiful of its class in the whole range of music, and nothing, indeed, can be more plain or straightforward, and at the same time more appropriate to the words of the grand Ambrosian hymn than the opening phrases, “ We praise Thee, O God ; we acknowledge Thee to be the Lord"". For dignity, power, and a grand conception of the text we must go on to that part of the Te Deum commencing, “ When Thou tookest upon Thee to deliver man.” The manner in which this sublime passage is built up, rising chord upon chord with rich and flowing music, seems as if it would never stop until it reached the gates of heaven itself. It would, I think, be an improvement, of which the composer himself approved, if the closing phrase of this sublime Te Deum were sung slower and very piano, instead of in strict and unrelenting time. Smart’s Te Deum is a pattern in plan and execution. It has served to create an emulative feeling, to open new fountains, and to justify and encourage freedom in form, and a strong exhibition of individual spirit. The Creed of St. Athanasius was sung to Tallis’s old two-note chant, consisting of C and B only in the melody, and this becomes somewhat monotonous unless a great power of tone and expression be given to certain passages of the text, especially at the words, “ but One God,” etc., which is greatly enhanced by a slow and deliberate accentuation. The “Introit” (which formerly was an antiphone sung while the priest proceeded to the altar to celebrate Mass), was, “ How lovely are the messengers,” from Mendelssohn’s St. Paul and the “Anthem,” an extract from Spohr’s Last Judgment, “ And lo! a throne,” etc. Both of these were sung with good taste, and in the latter the beautiful voice of Mr. Blagbro was heard to great advantage in the solos. It would, perhaps, have been more satisfactory if one of the anthems had been by an English composer, and surely there could have been no difficulty in finding such a work. The only hymn sung was, “ Holy, Holy, Holy,” to Dykes’s well-known tune Trinity, in which the congregation joined with great devotional fervour. The Post Communion Service was Tours in F, and, excellent as it is in its way, I could not help regretting that Smart’s magnificent setting was not taken so as to have continued his services throughout the day. The whole of this important part of the service, especially the unaccompanied responses and hymn, exhibited in the highest degree the efficiency of the choir. It has been truly said that the high choir service of our Church was made out of the office of Morning Prayer. The Communion office or Mass is, of course, the high musical service in the Latin Church ; but our English Communion office, until within these few years, was a sober, secret, and almost somniferous celebration, without choir, and almost without communicants. And so it is now in too many of our local churches. But more of this hereafter.
The service was concluded with what is known as Stainer’s ""Amen,” introduced first in St. Paul’s Cathedral, for which it was specially written. It contains some fine harmonical progressions, and is undoubtedly very cleverly put together, but there are two bars therein so very much like one of Palestrina’s celebrated works as would almost cause me to mistake one for the other. During the departure of the congregation, Dr. Creser played an expressive little voluntary on the sweet stops of the echo and choir organs, which were, I believe, voiced by Schulze himself.
On special occasions—Christmastide and Lent—oratorios are given in the Parish Church with increased musical resources, and greatly, I am persuaded, to the religious edification of those who attend them. Listening to an oratorio or an anthem is no direct act of worship, whether in or out of a church, nor is listening to a sermon ; but the hearing of an oratorio is, with that of hearing a sermon, a religious act, and commonly a much more profitable and instructive employment of time.
&nbsp;I will conclude this notice by observing that all church music should be of so exalted a character as will delight the genuine composer, exhilarate the organist and singers, and stimulate each and all to exert their utmost abilities for the attainment of a musical service as faultless as possible.",187u-Ll-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leeds,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/7d522e3f4b932d95a02aa2fc4995add7/1469632327646,Public Indoor Accompanied,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Dr+William+Spark/1465384918944,Dr William Spark,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Male_vocals http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_music

Far more satisfactory was that of ""Le Nozze di Figaro,"" with Jenny Lind as Susanna, Cruvelli as the Countess, and the whole bass force of the establishment (unusually strong for any one operatic troupe), comprising Lablache, Coletti, Beletti, and Bouche.

The former took their places in the orchestra, but the solo singers came into the body of the Hall. This gave us a fine opportunity of seeing them all, and of shaking hands with some of them.
[...]
The rehearsal commenced at 11 o’clock, and (with the exception of the necessary intermission for refreshments) continued until nearly 12 at night. Such pieces only were taken up as were new, or not generally known. A part of Samson, a new posthumous motette by Mendelssohn, his fragment of an oratorio, Christus, and also of
Lorelie. Beethoven’s great 9th, and various other pieces belonging to the evening performances, were more or less rehearsed. Beethoven’s Choral Symphony occupied about two hours. It was evidently the piece for the success of which Mr. Costa felt the greatest anxiety — since it is the most difficult composition on the programme; and he spared no effort to make its performance perfect. It was originally written for the London Philharmonic Society; but it was not performed with any success until long after its production.
This rehearsal-day was full of interest and instruction, and afforded us an opportunity of standing a little behind the curtain, and of seeing something more of the principal vocalists than we otherwise could have done.

How beautiful were the tones of that truly grand organ—how sweetly they travelled to my ears from the north transept to the furthest corner of the church, where I was seated! There should always, I think, be an introductory voluntary, whether there is a processional hymn or not. It has, if properly selected, or ably improvised, a calming influence on the mind, which prepares, with dulcet music, the humble worshipper for his subsequent duties.
The sounds of the organ die away, the distant “Amen” after the choristers’ prayer is heard, and the procession of the priests and white-robed choir from the vestry to their stalls in the chancel, is accompanied with a more joyous strain from the organ, which gradually subsides, and the respected vicar, the Rev. G. Hume Smith, then commences to intone the sentences, preces, etc., in a manner which shows at once that you are listening to one who,“with practice severe and tone loud and clear,” has attained to the highest point of chanting power, not to be wondered at when the Vicar’s long connection as Precentor with the Leeds Parish Church is remembered. The Versicles and responses by Tallis were nicely sung by the choir, with the exception of the usual drop in the pitch. The grand old chant in C, of whose authorship we know nothing more than that it is called “ Ancient,” was a right one for Venite, Exultemus, and with hearty and expressive alternate unison and harmony did the choir unto Sing unto the Lord.”
The Psalms (6th day), commencing with the 30th, Exaltabo te, Dotnine (“I will magnify Thee, O Lord”) were sung to the old familiar appropriate double chant in E flat, by Robinson (John, who was organist at Westminster Abbey in 1762), and another by an unknown author. The Psalms throughout, from Monk and Ouseley’s Psalter, were chanted admirably—clearness and distinctness of enunciation, good intonation, and an exactitude of time and ensemble worthy of a cathedral choir. The same may be said of the Te Deum, also given to a double chant, without any change or variety, and this I think might be rectified either by the introduction of specially composed Te Deum chants, or the more easy settings—anthem-wise. A fine, solemn effect was obtained by the singing of the verse “Holy, Holy, Holy!” without organ accompaniment, and in which the sweet female voices of the choir added greatly to the result. The Apostle’s Creed, monotoned with varied organ accompaniment on A, made the pitch rather too high for the subsequent sentences and responses.
The anthem by Stainer, “Jesus said unto his disciples"" sung very nicely, though it presented no particular features of power or interest, was preceded by a much too long introduction on the organ, not reminding one of any particular theme or subject, though serving as a medium for showing the good and varied qualities in the organ. After an excellent rendition of the Litany by the Rev. Percy Stewart (curate) Tours’ Communion Service in F was taken, and here again the clear voice and distinct enunciation of the vicar could be heard in every part of the vast building,—thus proving the advantages of intoning in all large edifices, where otherwise the ordinary mode of reading would be absorbed in echoes and a jumble of words. The composer has cleverly varied his Kyrie Eleison in D by the introduction of the minor key, at the same time preserving something of its original melodic structure. The closing phrase to the words, “And write all these Thy laws in our hearts— We beseech Thee” is extremely devotional and impressive.",187u-Ll-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leeds,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/91c6243a07496614b959a7f7ba2b0d9f/1469630278250,Accompanied Indoor Public,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Dr+William+Spark/1465384918944,Dr William Spark,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chorale

MR. GARDNER, of Leicester, writes: ""At the hazard of my ribs, I placed myself at the Opera two hours and a half before the concert began The concert opened with BEETHOVEN'S second symphony, admirably played by the Philharmonic band, after which LABLACHE sang 'Largo al Factotum' with much applause, and was encored. A breathless silence, and every eye was watching the action of this extraordinary violinist; and as he glided from the side scenes to the front of the stage, an involuntary cheering burst from every part of the house, many rising from their scats to view the Spectre during the thunder of this unprecedented cheering his gaunt and extraordinary appearance being more like that of a devotee about to suffer martyrdom than one to delight you with his art. With the tip of his bow he sent off the orchestra in a grand military movement with a force and vivacity as surprising as it was new.

In the evening to the Opera. Venice is the land of late hours: the scene in St. Mark's Place at midnight is more gay and animated than at any hour of the day; and it is after the opera that evening parties and conversazioni commence. The Gondoliers no longer sing the verses of Tasso; but you are frequently regaled with beautiful music from parties of dilettanti musicians. I ought to record, as an instance of the obliging civility of the Italians, that I met a serenading party in a Gondola to-night, singing very beautifully to their guitars the songs of a favourite opera.

Like most societies of the period, the Handel and Haydn was composed of both instrumental and vocal members. Amateur players comprised about two thirds, and professionals one third, of the orchestra. The professionals were engaged to “ help out.” We were paid the modest sum of two dollars for each evening, whether concert or rehearsal, every Sunday through the season. It was an invaluable apprenticeship. I believe that musicians of the present day, who do not have the slow building-up through the regular performance of oratorios, lose a schooling no other music can give. Old Bostonians were great gainers by being permeated with the Messiah, the Israel in Egypt, Samson, Jephtha, Solomon, Saul, Judas Maccabeeus, Acis and Galatea, and Esther, all by Handel; the Creation, the Seasons, and masses, by Haydn; the Elijah, St. Paul, and the Hymn of Praise, by Mendelssohn ; and the Requiem and other masses, by Mozart",180u-uu-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boston,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/fa251f5c6e696635305168d99c3437c6/1450198572905,Indoor Accompanied Public,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Thomas+Ryan/1448997315048,Thomas Ryan,Performance,,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oratorio

One was the first production in London of Wagner's “Lohengrin”; the other, the first appearance there of the Carl Rosa Opera Company. The former was regarded almost in the light of an experiment. Never before had an opera by Wagner been performed at Covent Garden. In 1870 his “Fliegende Hollander” had been given at Drury Lane, under the Italian title of “L’Ollandese Dannato"" (Luigi Arditi conducting), but without any very marked success. And now here was “Lohengrin”, a more advanced example of the composer's method, about to claim the suffrages of a public still notoriously unprepared for the comprehension or enjoyment of what was generally described as the “music of the future”. Yet, thanks to the growing numbers of the German community, the event aroused intense excitement, and the opera-house was packed to overflowing. I think it was the worst performance of “Lohengrin” ever seen in an important theatre. Albani (then in her third season) made a sympathetic Elsa; Nicolini presented a heroic-looking Lohengrin and sang wonderfully well, considering how completely out of his element he was in Wagnerian opera; and Cotogni did creditably as Telramund. But the remainder of the cast were beneath notice, while the chorus sang dreadfully out of tune, and the orchestra, under Vianesi, did its best to drown the singers throughout. Yet, in spite of these drawbacks, the beauty of the music exercised its inevitably powerful sway, and the opera was received with a warmth that grew and grew till it culminated in a tremendous climax of enthusiasm. The “tooth-and-nail” opponents of Wagner, who flourished exceedingly in London at this time, were simply dumfounded. In all probability, “Lohengrin” was as new to them as it was to Covent Garden habitues, and they did not know whether to be more astonished at the subtle fascination of the music or at the ease with which its charm and significance had been grasped by an “unripe” public. In vain did James Davison print Cassandra-like utterances in the “Times”; equally in vain did my dear and valued friend Joseph Bennett limit himself to lukewarm admiration in the columns of the “Telegraph."" The success of “Lohengrin” in London was complete.",1875-uu-uu,,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/b6524ad7dd4e1cb39ef9483aac476168/1438166868885,Accompanied Public Indoor,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Hermann+Klein/1438157240872,Hermann Klein,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

Anticipating this, our company, consisting of three persons, went a little before the time appointed for the opening of the door; but yet we found a crowd gathered; the room filled immediately as the door was opened, but we succeeded in obtaining good seats. We had now to wait a full hour before the music commenced, but in the midst of such a multitude of good-looking and well-dressed ladies and gentlemen, all in conversation in loud and merry voices, it soon passed away. Half an hour before the commencement, the oboe was heard, running the scales, &amp;c.; this was soon followed by faggotti, corni, clarionetti, and strings; every man tuning and getting his instrument and his fingers in readiness. Mendelssohn seemed to look down from his bust immediately opposite the orchestra with approbation. At half-past six precisely, Kapelmeister Rietz takes his stand — the signal is given — every one is silent and attentive, and Beethoven’s overture (op. 124) fills the whole company with delight. This is a very pleasing overture; it is less learned, but of a more popular character than most of Beethoven’s. It is often marked with a rhythm like the music of the march or dance; and the flourishes of the brass instruments and drums almost lead one to suppose that he is listening to a military band. But still the hand of the master is seen, and although Beethoven comes down and freely holds conversation with the people, yet he always preserves his dignity, and never dishonors his profession in this pleasing composition.
A very good singer followed; Frau Leopoldine Tuczek-Herrenburg, from Berlin, in a Recitative and Arie from the opera of “Sylvana,” by C. Maria von Weber.
This was followed by a grand Concerto for the Piano Forte, with orchestral accompaniment (G moll), composed by J. Moschelles, and played by Clara Schumann. I have already spoken of Madame Schumann’s playing; her performance of this Concerto was perfect, and received the warmest approbation from the audience.
An air of De Beriot followed, by Frau Tuczek-Herrenburg; after which Madame Schumann played most charmingly a Notturno (B. major) for piano forte, by F. Chopin. In this she was encored, and played in answer to the call another piece unknown to the writer.
The second part of the concert was that in which the musical ones were most deeply interested, for it consisted of Robert Schumann's new Symphonie. This has not been published, and was played from manuscript, conducted by the author, who was cordially greeted on his appearance at the head of the orchestra. It is undoubtedly a work of great merit; but it is truly a great work, and can only be performed by a very thoroughly trained band. Its analogies and correspondencies are deeper and more hidden than in Mozart or Beethoven, but nevertheless they are there, and can be discovered to some extent even at a first hearing. The Symphonie consists of five movements, there being in addition to the usual movements a short adagio (fourth) introduced. In the second movement (scherzo), there is playfulness and relief, but throughout the whole the idea of greatness prevails; so much so as almost to oppress one with a feeling of grandeur and sublimity. The fourth movement especially seems to partake in the highest degree of this character, and stirs up the deep feelings to awe and reverence. But vain is any attempt at description, especially by one who has heard it but at a single performance. It was played with great energy; every member of the orchestra had enough to do. The captain inspired confidence, and the result was most satisfactory. There was but a momentary pause between the parts, and in this respect the learned conductor’s example is well worthy of imitation. The Symphonie occupied thirty-three minutes in its performance, and at half-past eight the concert closed.",http://data.open.ac.uk/time/interval/1852-03-uuT18:30:00/to/1852-03-uuT20:30:00,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/0a19459865ed69275723d6efb76048c9,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/fff723c8a1a0eca32b1d5444b3716eef/1448310211121,Indoor Accompanied Public,http://musicbrainz.org/artist/f422b99a-b48c-4bee-bc0c-f2e8cad82b6c#_,Dr. Lowell Mason Lowell Mason,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice http://dbpedia.org/resource/Female_vocals,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

Whilst chatting with his&nbsp;hostess, Liszt picked up the ""Tasso"" arrangement by chance, asked her whether she had heard it, and on&nbsp;receiving a reply in the negative, said that he would&nbsp;gladly make it known to her, if she could find any one&nbsp;amongst her guests to play it with him. There were&nbsp;several Italian pianists, virtuosi and amateurs, present,&nbsp;but none of them would venture to attempt so difficult a&nbsp;work at sight, especially in conjunction with its composer, of whom one and all evidently stood in awe.&nbsp;Archbishop Haynald (he had not then received the red&nbsp;hat), whose rooms were next to mine at the Albergo di Roma, and who had placed his excellent grand piano at&nbsp;my disposal immediately upon his arrival in the Eternal&nbsp;City, came up to me and said, ""Hoeren Sie mal, mein&nbsp;Lieber! you have played a good many hard pieces (schwere Stuecke) at sight with me during the past six&nbsp;weeks.

Will you make the attempt?&nbsp;The thing is difficult enough — more than enough."" I&nbsp;thought of Liszt's dubitative smile, when Herbeck had&nbsp;introduced me to him as an Englishman who ""knew&nbsp;music,"" and at once replied, ""Will your Grandeur vouch&nbsp;for me?

Haynald took me by the arm&nbsp;and led me up to the illustrious compatriot, saying, ""Franz, thou knowest this young man.

Many of our best immigrant musicians came to America at that period; among whom were the Germania, and, one year later (in 1849), the famous Gungl Orchestra, from Berlin, with the composer at its head. Their venture was a fiasco. The orchestra numbered about twenty-five. They did not play so well as the Germania, consequently did not have the elements of a possible success. About the only souvenir I have of their visit is the hour I spent at the first rehearsal of the new waltz Traum des Oceans—a fine waltz, probably Gungl’s best, which was written while on his voyage to America. Gungl did not give many concerts in Boston, and I think that shortly after his visit he returned to Germany. It is my impression that he did not take many of his men back with him.",1849-uu-uu,,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/0bd64a7301f29e7159bc215a31d7459a/1450196519542,Indoor Accompanied Public,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Thomas+Ryan/1448997315048,Thomas Ryan,Performance,,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_music

Such morning concerts are quite common in the larger German cities. An individual, having the means to do it, employs at his own expense an orchestra, or more probably a quartet, or quintet, makes out his own programme, and invites his friends to spend a couple of hours in listening to fine music. On the present occasion, an audience of perhaps two hundred persons (the most musical people of Frankfort) were brought together. Schindler, the biographer of Beethoven, Schmidt the pianist, and other distinguished persons, were present. The concert consisted of both vocal and instrumental music; and Music’s sister, Elocution, was also brought in, and lent her aid in the exercises of the occasion. The programme contained the following pieces (though not in the order in which they are here put down), viz.:— &nbsp;Quintet (G. minor), Mozart, charmingly — I suppose it may be, said, perfectly played by Messrs. Wolff, Baldenecker, Posch, Drinnenberg, and Siedentopf. Quintet Movement, Mozart. This very beautiful movement by Mozart has not before been played since the year 1783. It has been recently discovered in Mozart’s own hand-writing, among his manuscripts, which for some twenty years have been in the family of André of Offenbach. It will shortly be published. Recitative and Air, with violoncello and obligato accompaniment, composed by John Sebastian Bach. This song is quite of a popular character, notwithstanding it is by Bach, reminding one somewhat of Handel’s most popular songs. It is a sacred song, from an unpublished cantate; but the Recitative and Song will soon be published. Part-Songs, for soprano, alto, tenor, and bass. Two songs were sung by a well-trained double quartet. A Poem on Mozart was well read by a lady, having a rich alto voice, Fraulein Gräemann. The effect of introducing this elocutionary exercise was very pleasing, and the example is a good one to be followed wherever a really excellent reader can be found to sustain the part. Strangers are sometimes invited to play in these concerts; and on the present occasion two pianoforte pieces, “Amitie pour amitie,” composed by the performer, and Doneyschock’s Rhapsodie in C. Minor, were played by Mr. William Mason of Boston, U. S.

The cathedral is the largest in Holland, much higher than Westminster Abbey, and of great length. I placed myself at the eastern end, and upon the organist giving out the tune I became paralysed with astonishment. A stop called the Vox humana led the congregation, which so predominated over the double diapasons, that it seemed like the voice of a monster issuing from this mountain of sounds. The roulades or flourishes introduced between the lines could only be compared to the rolling...of the surges upon the seashore.

I recollect how perfectly she sang some French pieces and a new romanza (""II primo amore,"" I think it was called) expressly composed for her by Romili. But what dwells most vividly in my memory in connection with this concert is her extreme kindness to my brother Max, who was down in the same programme for a violin solo. The great artist insisted on sitting among the audience to listen to the little English fiddler (then about thirteen); and he had just started his solo when one of his strings broke. He gave one glance of consternation round the room and then incontinently burst into tears. The audience looked half amused ; but Alboni rose from her seat, walked to my brother, and, kissing him upon the forehead, said, loudly enough for every one to hear, ""N'importe, mon petit ami; ne pleurs pas!

The way she lingered over the notes to which those words “thy soft eyes” were set, was absolutely lovely; nor have I ever heard it sung with anything like the exquisite tenderness and restrained passion she put into it.

The name of Anton Seidl may perhaps be missed from the group of leading German conductors enumerated above. As a matter of fact, however, Seidl scarcely had an opportunity of displaying his powers in London as a concert conductor. His appearances there were solely in connection with opera— the “Nibelungen "" performances at Her Majesty's in 1882, and the German representations at Covent Garden in 1897. In the course of the latter I saw him frequently, and one night he accompanied me to a Richter concert at St. James's Hall. He had not seen his great Viennese rival upon the platform for many years, and was especially curious to hear his rendering of Tschaikowsky's “Pathetique "" symphony. He was delighted with every feature save one. Directly after starting the second (5-4) movement, Richter laid down his baton and allowed the band to proceed without guidance to the end of the piece. Seidl knit his brows and looked stern, but did not utter a word till the room was ringing with applause. Then he turned to me and said: ''I wish he had not done that. It was to show that, in spite of the awkward rhythm, his men could keep perfectly together without the beat, and maintain the necessary precision all through the movement. So they did; but the result was a very machine-like performance. It was much less crisp and animated than it would have been if Richter had conducted it with his arm as well as with his eyes!'",1897-uu-uu,,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/15a7fc9616436e6d424b7dc3f719ed20/1438590297620,Indoor Accompanied Public,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Hermann+Klein/1438157240872 http://musicbrainz.org/artist/2eac59bd-a1ff-403a-925d-3982a8794be7#_,Hermann Klein Anton Sedll Anton Seidl,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Symphony

En route, after a voyage of fourteen days, we stopped at Honolulu. It had been arranged for us to give a concert in that city if circumstances permitted. When our ship was approaching the shore, on June 5, 1882, but was still about two miles from the wharf, a fleet of small boats came out to meet friends, and from one of them came the questions, “ Is the Quintette Club on board ? Are they ready to give the concert ?” To which we joyfully replied, “Yes.” Thereupon, the boat signaled &nbsp;the wharf, and the news was sent to the telephone office. Thence it was promptly speeded round the city, reserved seats were taken with a rush, and we had a fine audience. Nearly all the passengers on our ship, 250 in number, were present, as well as the best society in the place, including King Kalakaua and his court, crowding the boxes of the opera house.

Printers have played some funny tricks with our programmes at times. It is a dangerous thing not to see a “proof"" before printing, but often the programme has to be “ rushed,” and there is no opportunity. One of our violinists was to play a solo on the old French air, “ Je suis le petit tambour."" When the concert was over, my attention was called to this number on the programme, which read, to my horror, “ Jesus le petit tambour.""
At another time, Mr. Schultze was playing nightly the old caprice by Miska Hauser, entitled, The Bird in the Tree. Writing the programme one day in the office of the printer, I incautiously wrote, “ Bird business, Mr. Schultze,” supposing that they would print the full title as usual. The programmes were printed without giving me a chance to read the proof. When we came to that special number, we noticed a peculiar buzz and fun- enjoying condition among our auditors. When the concert was over, we inquired the cause, and a friend replied, handing us a programme, “ We wanted to know when Mr. Schultze was to begin his ‘ bird business.’ ” It was a funny way to learn a useful lesson.",180u-Ll-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/North_America,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/892fb8aeff182d7165097aef03c30308/1450351290977,Accompanied Public,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Unknown+listeners/1450350588133 http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Thomas+Ryan/1448997315048,Unknown listeners Thomas Ryan,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chamber_orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Light_music

It was the spring of 1842, and it was also the rapid and wondrous turn of the tide for WAGNER. He hurried to Dresden, to find the rehearsals of Rienzi already advanced. The opera was produced with that singular burst of enthusiasm which greets the first appreciation of an important but long-neglected truth, and WAGNER, having become the favourite of the Crown Prince, was elected Kapellmeister at Dresden, and found himself for the first time famous. Some might now have rested on their laurels, but to WAGNER'S imperious development Rienzi was already a thing of the past.",1842-uu-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dresden,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/1eb9a5d0d14ebf6d37d85c6e07af7dea/1437986534233,Public Accompanied Indoor,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Concert+audience/1437737637011,Concert audience,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

Since Easter, the Motets with Orchestra have been resumed; and to-day, the musical exercises were somewhat different from what they usually are. A Chorale was first sung; but there were not many people to join in. The exercises commence precisely at eight o’clock, whether anybody is there or not; and sometimes I have attended public worship, when there was no one present at the commencement, except the singers. After the chorale to-day, the first two movements of a mass by Cherubini were sung, “Kyrie,” and “Gloria in excelsis;"" sung, too, not in the vernacular language of the land, but in the original Greek and Latin. The “Kyrie &nbsp;commenced with a short Violoncello solo; this is followed by a vocal solo for a Bass voice; after which the other parts join. There is much solo throughout the movement. The music, although very fine, did not appear to me to be very supplicating in its character, nor did it seem to urge the cry for mercy as one might suppose David urged it in the fifty-first psalm. At the close of the “Kyrie,” the minister, at the altar, chanted a few words of prayer, and then followed a brilliant “Gloria in excelsis,” mostly in chorus. A fugue is introduced, and the closing movement, to the word Amen, is very animating and triumphant. At the close of the “Gloria,” the minister chanted the collect for the day with response by the choir; afterwards followed prayer, and then came a very fine Motet or Hymn with Orchestra, composed by Spohr. The moment this closed, choir and orchestra scattered, and were seen no more. The organ instantly announced a chorale, and the loud congregational chorus arose, most cheering, most refreshing, Sabbath-like, a song of worship, solemn, grand, majestic, “fit for an angel to play, or a martyr to hear;"" raising one’s feelings, and bringing home thoughts of God, heaven, holiness, redemption, and eternity.",1852-04-Ee,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/5f1fc11e8124c7de007bbab57e4fb697,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/7139b7986c5e16fd7a6ee0e3f924a842/1448316270705,Indoor Accompanied Public,http://musicbrainz.org/artist/f422b99a-b48c-4bee-bc0c-f2e8cad82b6c#_,Dr. Lowell Mason Lowell Mason,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Choir http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_music

The subsequent reunion at the hotel found every one in the highest spirits. Beside the three artists, there were present Mme. Nordica’s sister (Mrs. Walker) and Mr. Amherst Webber, the talented English maestro at piano who had recently acted as accompanist to the brothers in their Wagnerian studies. After supper the conversation turned upon Bayreuth, and allusion was made to a certain half-promise given by Jean de Reszke to Frau Cosima, that he would one day sing Tristan and Walther, or perhaps even Siegfried, at the festival. I remarked that, after what I had heard that night, I entertained no doubts concerning the adequate quality of his accent. This only elicited a further request that I would stay in New York until I had heard how it sounded in “Tristan”. Then the distinguished tenor turned to Mme. Nordica and proposed that, as I was evidently not to be made to alter my determination, the best thing they could do would be to “bring the mountain to Mohammed"" and sing some “Tristan” to me there and then; and that between one and two in the morning, and after a heavy opera like “Lohengrin""! Surely it was not possible. But surprise and incredulity quickly changed to delight. For, without an instant's hesitation, Mme. Nordica consented ; Mr. Webber went to the piano and played a few introductory bars; and, almost before I could realize what was being done, the two gifted artists were warbling the wondrous love scene from Wagner's immortal music-drama.

They did not spare themselves, either, these generous friends. They sang with full voice; they went through not only the scene with which they had started, but the duet of the first act as well; and, from beginning to end, the exquisite beauty of their phrasing, the blending of their voices in perfect intonation and unity of color, the significance of their supreme dramatic interpretation, constituted at once a marvel and a revelation. It was a strange experience, sitting at the supper-table (for none of us but Mr. Webber had moved from our seats) while for an hour or more those two famous singers reveled in the enjoyment of their self-imposed task— undertaken for the sole purpose of conferring pleasure upon an old friend. The picture of that night remains vividly imprinted upon my mind, even as its vocal spell lives fresh and fragrant among my most treasured memories.

Every where offerings are making, processions are moving, hymns are selling, and monks and nuns are invoking or begging. In all this, however, there is neither gloom nor austerity. The monks are jolly—the nuns are gay— and the votarists, more zealous than meditative, are bustling, elbowing, laughing, praying, whispering, and chanting. In every stall psalms and legends are hung up, like rows of ballads in the less devout streets of other cities. The stories of sinners become Saints are set forth in strains that belong rather to the frailty, than contrition of the penitent. The Magdalen here tells her story in phrases adapted to the passionate melodies of PAESIELLO; and Saint Therese leaves the enamoured ""Didone"" of the Opera far behind in the expression of pathetic ardour.

The two most impressive and deeply-affecting scenes are those in which the vestal fire is suffered to expire, and in which the frail priestess is buried alive. In the first of these scenes, the Vestal (returned from the Circus) is discovered in the deep solitudes of the temple, love-stricken by the victor she has crowned. […] She stands deeply absorbed in thought, and in her countenance the most passionate abstraction is perfectly expressed; while the music which symphonizes to her reverie, seems a part of her own sensations. 
[…]&nbsp;
The funeral scene opens with a procession of the consuls, patricians, and people of Rome, the military, lictors, and the priestesses of the temple, accompanied by a sad and solemn music, in march to the Campus sceleratus, where the Vestal's tomb is already dug.

Meanwhile, LISZT laying his hand upon my arm, we passed through the library, opening into his bed-room, and thence to a little sitting-room (the same which commanded that view of the Campagna). Here stood his grand Erard piano. ""As we were talking of bells” he said, ""I should like to show you an 'Angelus' which I have just written-""; and, opening the piano, he sat down. This was the moment which I had so often and so vainly longed for. 
When I left England, it seemed to me as impossible that I should ever hear LISZT play, as that I should ever see MENDELSSOHN, who has been in his grave for thirty-three years. How few of the present generation have had this privilege ! At Bayreuth, I had hoped, but no opportunity offered itself, and it is well known that LISZT can hardly ever be prevailed upon to open the piano in the presence of strangers. A favourite pupil, POLIG, who was then with him at the Villa d'Este, told me he rarely touched the piano, and that he himself had seldom heard him ""but,"" he added with enthusiasm, ""when the master touches the keys, it is always with the same incomparable effect, unlike anvone else, always perfect."" 
""You know,"" said LISZT, turning to me, ""they ring the ‘Angelus' in Italy carelessly; the bells swing irregularly, and leave off, and the cadences are often broken up thus"": and he began a little swaying passage in the treble like bells tossing high up in the evening air: it ceased, but so softly that the half-bar of silence made itself felt, and the listening ear still carried the broken rhythm through the pause. The Abbate himself seemed to fall into a dream; his fingers fell again lightly on the keys, and the bells went on, leaving off in the middle of a phrase. Then rose from the bass the song of the Angelus, or rather, it seemed like the vague emotion of one who, as he passes, hears in the ruins of some wayside cloister the ghosts of old monks humming their drowsy melodies, as the sun goes down rapidly, and the purple shadows of Italy steal over the land, out of the orange west! 
We sat motionless the disciple on one side, I on the other. LISZT was almost as motionless: his fingers seemed quite independent, chance ministers of his soul. The dream was broken by a pause; then came back the little swaying passage of bells, tossing high up in the evening air, the half-bar of silence, the broken rhythm and the Angelus was rung.",1880-uu-uu,,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/4311a75b26f5185ba71a8411a285d1ee/1438005682063,Domestic Indoor Accompanied,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hugh_Reginald_Haweis,Hugh Reginald Haweis,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Piano,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/musicgenre/angelus

There was no motette with orchestra, on account of Lent. The services were as follows; the order is so different from ours, that I have thought it would be interesting to many to have it given in detail. I timed each piece, and give the time which each occupied.

2. Motette, without accompaniment ..... 9 &nbsp; &nbsp;""

The motette (2) may be found, with a free translation of the words, at p. 290, Cantica Laudis, “Though all earthly joys should perish”; and this will give some idea of what kind of music is done by the choir without accompaniment. The liturgical service (5) was chanted by the minister at the altar, with responses by the choir. The reading (6) was also at the altar, but the minister turned and faced the people. The reading (9) was from the reading desk. Sermon (12) from the pulpit. The ministers all wear a black robe, with a white surplice over it, as well in preaching as in prayer; also a large ruff, say two and a half or three inches wide, round the neck, as is seen in portraits of the Reformers and clergymen of 300 years ago. No fires in the churches, however cold. The service begins punctually at 1/2 past 8 o’clock in the morning, and it requires, something of an effort to be up and ready on the morning of a short and cold winter’s day.

Music was almost entirely neglected during my years at Miss Reach’s. I had no lessons, but was sent to practise by myself for an hour every afternoon on a horrid little upright piano in the dreary dining-room.
&nbsp;
Of course I did nothing of the sort; in the first place, I had nothing to practise, for I certainly had no intention of learning any of the really dreadful drawing-room pieces with which the piano was covered. Occasionally I played through one of them, for I read music quite easily. How I jibbed at the “Prière d’une Vierge”! The “Gems of Scotland,” set in arpeggios and triplets, were sham jewels for which I had unmitigated contempt, and one or two pieces by Brinsley Richards made my flesh creep. I had such frightful attacks of low spirits in that dreary back room that I never think of it without horror. After some months I began to connect music itself with those four walls and those hideous tenth-rate compositions which lay in bilious green and yellow covers on the top of the piano, and it seemed to me that my own love of music was being slowly poisoned to death. So much for atmosphere! When I left Miss Reach’s at the end of the year, I would not have cared if I had never set eyes on a piano again. I almost hated the sight of one. Something lovely in me had died.

""Indeed it is,"" said my kind hostess, ""especially in a place like this — the very corner of the world."" I was pressed to give them a song... I sat down to the pianoforte, and sang Haydn's Canzonet, ""My mother bids me bind my hair"" which seemed to touch their little hearts.

To return to our travels, we gave a farewell concert at Sydney which was very gratifying. The music-lovers had decorated the stage with flowers and large English and American flags.

In his Carnaval de Ventse, he exhibited a mastery over every form of violin technics which quite reached the marvellous. His chromatic scale, played staccato from the lowest to the highest note, and down again to the lowest, in one bow,— either an up or down bow,—was a feat, a tour de force, shown us by no other virtuoso. His double trills and double harmonics were perfect. Nor was it in mere technical playing that he was great, for he played with much sentiment and feeling, and in quartette playing he showed his best quality. He was the master-player and king of all I have heard.

Jenny Lind’s repertoire during her American tour was the "" Casta Diva,” from Norma ; “ With Verdure Clad ” and “ On Mighty Pens,” from the Creation; a cavatina from Beatrice de Tenda, by Bellini; the great song with two flutes from the Star of the North, by Meyerbeer ; and “ Non mi Dor,” from Don Giovanni, by Mozart. She also sang in the trio from II Barbier, and, with Belletti, the duo from L'Elisire d'Amore, and a great variety of the Swedish folk-songs. With the latter she nearly always ended her concerts.
She used to introduce imitations of mountain echoes in the Swedish songs, and people said she did it ventriloquially, but I have always maintained that it was done by very refined pianissimo singing.
I have often been asked, “ How much of a singer was Jenny Lind?” I can say she deserved all that was claimed for her, unmusical, nonsensical stories excepted. Her voice was of extensive range, reaching easily to D in alt,—a voice of veiled quality with something of the essence of a tear in it. She had almost unlimited execution, sang with great earnestness, and did everything in a highly finished, broad style. Such pieces as the “ Casta Diva ” and I Know that my Redeemer Liveth she sang with so devotional a sentiment that she really seemed like some inspired priestess proclaiming her faith.",180u-Mm-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/North_America,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/156757edda1f470b59297b04ad915fd6/1450269499082,Public Accompanied,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Thomas+Ryan/1448997315048,Thomas Ryan,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soprano http://dbpedia.org/resource/Female_vocals,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

A host in herself was the accomplished and captivating Pauline Lucca, who, after an absence of ten years, returned to Covent Garden in 1882 to gratify opera-goers once more with her unrivaled impersonations of Selika in “L’Africaine”, Cherubino in “”Le Nozze”, Zerlina in “Fra Diavolo”, Leonora in “La Favorita”, and other characters. Despite her twenty-three years upon the stage, this brilliant artist was now also at her best; her voice had lost none of its freshness, and the piquant grace of her style and the marked originality of her conceptions were even more striking than before. Her Selika I can best describe in a single word as a “dream” — a supreme achievement to be mentioned in the same breath with the Bosina of Adelina Patti and the Marguerite of Christine Nilsson. Supported by Mierzwinsky as Vasco da Gama, Lassalle as Nelusko, Bagagiolo as Pedro, and Valleria as Inez, Pauline Lucca's performance in “L'Africaine” is to be folded in the lavender of one's memory.&nbsp; ",1882-uu-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Covent_Garden,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/da446b7e34efc581a22260e5fcd837d4/1438261183248,Public Accompanied Indoor,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Hermann+Klein/1438157240872,Hermann Klein,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

One evening, just as he was getting his flute ready, and his musicians were assembled, an officer brought him the list of the strangers who had arrived. With his flute in his hand he ran over the list, but immediately turned to the assembled musicians, and said, with a kind of agitation, ‘ Gentlemen, old Bach is come.’ The flute was now laid aside, and old Bach, who had alighted at his son's lodgings, was immediately summoned to the palace. [...] 
But what is more important than this is that the King gave up his concert for this evening, and invited Bach, then already called ‘ the old Bach,’ to try his fortepianos, made by Silbermann, which stood in several rooms of the palace. The musicians went with him from room to room, and Bach was invited everywhere to try and to play unpremeditated compositions. After he had gone on for some time, he asked the King to give him a subject for a fugue, in order to execute it immediately without any pre­paration. The King admired the learned manner in which his subject was thus executed extempore ; and, probably to see how far such an art can be carried, expressed a wish to hear a fugue with six obbligato parts. But as it is not every subject that is fit for such full harmony, Bach chose one himself, and immediately executed it, to the astonishment of all present, in the same magnificent and learned manner as he had done that of the King. His Majesty desired also to hear his performance on the organ. The next day, therefore, Bach was taken to all the organs in Potsdam, as he had before been to Silbermann’s fortepianos.

Eighteen hundred and eighty-two was London's great Wagner year. Hitherto we had been slowly paving the way only. Now, with almost startling suddenness, the metropolis found itself the scene of two weighty enterprises which were destined to give an even stronger fillip to the spread of the Bayreuth master's art than his own visit in 1877. To be candid, the double dose, taken well-nigh simultaneously, proved rather too heavy for the receptive capacity of the general public. But the German community again rallied in brave numbers to this musical call from the Fatherland, and, alike with money and plaudits, proffered substantial support to the cause. Early in the year a troupe had been formed by Herr Angelo Neumann for the purpose of performing “Der Ring des Nibelungen"" in the leading cities of Germany, Austria, Holland, England, and Italy. The months of May and June were chosen for the London visit, and Her Majesty's Theatre was engaged. In all, four cycles of the tetralogy were given. Of these I attended two, and then for the first time felt that I was beginning to obtain an insight into the real scope and meaning of this gigantic work. The casts included not a few of the famous artists who had taken part in the initial representation of the “Ring” at Bayreuth in 1876,— among them Niemann, linger, the Vogls, Hill, Schlosser, and Lilli Lehmann (who sang Woglinde, Helmivige, and the ""Bird"" music); with that admirable artist, Reicher-Kindermann, as Brilnnhilde. The conductor was the lamented Anton Seidl, who then made his first appearance in London. He at once won the high approval of connoisseurs by the skill which he displayed— with by no means first-rate material— in bringing out with clearness, refinement, and intellectuality the beauties of Wagner's colossal score. It was through no fault of Seidl's that the representations were at many points open to criticism; nor, we may be equally sure, was he responsible for the number of extensive ""cuts"" which disfigured the last two of the four music-dramas.",1882-uu-uu,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/efdd01e256923e4b69230e1f1a023076,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/890e0da28e1cd39c80a6021ff748342f/1438250541789,Indoor Public Accompanied,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Hermann+Klein/1438157240872,Hermann Klein,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

The programme of the first night, in spite of the listlessness with which the opera of ""Adelia"" was received, continued, with some slight variations in the ballet department, until the debut of Fornasari on the 25th of March. It is a very difficult task to enter upon the subject of this once admired basso. His first appearance in Donizetti's ""Belisario"" was justly hailed with rapture. Day after day the critical notices of the press teemed with eulogiums of the strongest kind. The unanimity of the critics was wonderful. Nothing was to be seen but the most abundant praise of his ""admirable voice,"" his perfect execution,"" his ""great dramatic genius,"" his ""wonderfully handsome person."" No such debut had been witnessed, they all assured the world, in the memory of man; and points in acting were noted as traits of noble genius, of which the artist himself was ignorant. ""Words of sufficient superlative import could scarcely be found to proclaim his triumph. He was ""the great success of a successful season."" So spoke the almost unanimous voice of the press, and I am bound to admit that the success of Fornasari in ""Belisario,"" and some other parts, was unquestionably great. His looks, stature, costume, and ""make up,"" rendered him the beau ideal of the victorious Roman General in the first act. No painter could have represented a personage more admirably calculated to satisfy the imagination and secure the sympathies of the spectator. As soon as he appeared the audience seemed struck as by an electric shock, and a genuine burst of applause, speedily warming into enthusiasm, recognised and welcomed the artist.",http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/day/1843-03-25,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Her_Majesty's_Theatre,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/9ac4d1c5c6062269df47441a16e5c0f0/1438613259497,Public Accompanied Indoor,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Benjamin+Lumley/1438607277398,Benjamin Lumley,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

Many of my pleasantest memories are connected with the workings of the [Musical] Fund Society. Mr. Webb was the first conductor, followed by “old Tom Comer.” The latter, a character in Boston, was well known and beloved. He was of Irish extraction and originally an actor. He had a passion for music—could compose a little, played the violin tolerably well, was leader of an orchestra in the Boston Museum for many years, and afterwards in the Boston Theatre.

One of his financial appeals in behalf of the Society is worth putting on record.

The GREAT THEATRE of Parma was once among the wonders of Italy. It was built by the sumptuous Farnese adjoining the palace, and was capable of containing fourteen thousand persons. It has not, however, been used since the beginning of the last century, and is not even open for inspection. The little theatre, where operas were performing when we were at Parma, offered a striking contrast to this Ducal edifice. It was extremely small, mean, filthy, ill-lighted, and shaped like a double square, long and narrow. We were present at the performance of the popular piece of Paul and Virginia, with the beautiful music of Guglielmi; but there was but a scanty audience, a circumstance accounted for by the wretchedness of the performance. Here, as in almost all the Italian cities (Milan and Naples excepted), the choruses were filled up by tradesmen, who, for about ten-pence a night, after they lay by their leather aprons, assume the costume of the dramatic wardrobe. They execute the music of Rossini, Mozart, &amp;c. coarsely indeed, and vociferously, but not inaccurately.

The stalls, boxes, and pit were crowded with&nbsp;the elite of Viennese society, fashionable, artistic, and&nbsp;literary...fill[ing] all the ""numbered''&nbsp;seats at the Wieden...&nbsp;whilst the galleries were thronged almost to suffocation by Strauss's most enthusiastic admirers — the true&nbsp;bom Viennese of the lower middle classes. Archduke&nbsp;William — who, being Grand Master of the Order of St.&nbsp;John, seldom shows himself in a theatre — occupied the&nbsp;Imperial Box, whilst King Milan of Servia sate out the&nbsp;whole performance in a ground-tier stage box, signifying&nbsp;his admiration for the bénéficiaire's talents and achievements by conferring upon him, towards the close of the&nbsp;evening, the Cross of the Takovo Order. The progranmie of the occasion consisted of selections from&nbsp;Strauss's operas, conducted by himself. His desk was&nbsp;converted for the nonce into a gorgeous flower-bed of the&nbsp;costliest exotics; and his appearance thereat, baton in&nbsp;hand, was the signal for a demonstration of affectionate&nbsp;rejoicing on the part of the audience, such as, according&nbsp;to the leading journals of the Kaiserstadt, has never&nbsp;before been witnessed within the walls of a Vienna&nbsp;theatre. He opened the entertainment with his bright&nbsp;little overture to Indigo — his first opera, produced at the&nbsp;Wieden Theatre about twenty years ago — which was&nbsp;rapturously re-demanded. Then came the first act of A&nbsp;Night in Venice, followed by the immortal Schoene blaue&nbsp;Donau during the entr'acte, which inimitable waltz&nbsp;brought down a shower of laurel wreaths upon its composer's head. The second act of Fledermaus with some&nbsp;additions to the dialogue written especially for the&nbsp;occasion, came next, and was succeeded by ""musical&nbsp;episodes "" from Spitzentuch, Methusalem, Cagliostro, Der Lustige Krieg and the Carnival in Rome,&nbsp;each successive&nbsp;number being supplemented by presentations of addresses,&nbsp;medals, and flowers.&nbsp;",http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/day/1884-10-15,,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/67e2cac9030152726c71be7658badd19/1451947275177,Indoor Public Accompanied,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/William+Beatty-Kingston/1444079044346 http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Milian+I+of+Serbia/1451947039739,William Beatty-Kingston Milian I of Serbia,Performance,,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_music

I had conceived, ever since I had studied the life and works of CHOPIN, the greatest desire to hear him played by LISZT: indeed, the numbers of those CHOPIN still living who have had this privilege must be very limited. I ventured to say, ""CHOPIN always maintained that you were the most perfect exponent of his works. I cannot say how grateful I should be to hear, were it only a fugitive passage of CHOPIN'S, touched by your hand."" 
""With all the pleasure in the world“ replied the immortal pianist; and again I sat down by the grand piano, and humming to him a phrase of op. 37, I begged that it might be that. 
""I will play that, and another after it."" (The second was op. 48.) 
It is useless for me to attempt a description of a performance every phrase of which will be implanted in my memory, and on my heart, as long as I live. 
Again, in that room, with its long bright window opening out into the summer-land, we sat in deep shadow in perfect seclusion ; not a sound but the magic notes falling at first like a soft shower of pearls or liquid drops from a fountain blown spray falling hither and thither, and changing into rainbow tints in its passage, as the harmonic progression kept changing and tossing the fugitive fragments of melody with which that exquisite nocturne opens, until it settles into the calm, happy dream, which seems to rock the listener to sleep with the deep and perfect benison of ineffable rest; then out of the dream, through a few bars, like the uneasy consciousness of a slowly awakening sleeper, and again the interlude, the blown rain of double pearls until once more the heavenly dream is resumed. I drew my chair gently nearer, I almost held my breath, not to miss a note. There was a strange concentrated anticipation about LISZT'S playing unlike anything I had ever heard not for a moment could the ear cease listening; each note seemed prophetic of the next, each yielded in importance to the next : one felt that in the soul of the player the whole nocturne existed from the beginning as one and indivisible, like a poem in the heart of a poet. The playing of the bars had to be gone through seriatim; but there were glimpses of a higher state of intuition, in which one could read thoughts without words, and possess the soul of music, without the intervention of bars and keys and strings; all the mere elements seemed to fade, nothing but perception remained. Sense of time vanished; all was as it were realised in a moment, that moment the Present the eternal Present no Past, no Future. Yet I could not help noticing each incident: the perfect, effortless independence of the fingers, mere obedient ministers of the master's thought; the complete trance of the player living in the ideal world, and reducing the world of matter about him to the flimsiest of unreal shadows; and I had time to notice the unconscious habits of the master, which have already passed into historic manner- isms in his disciples, like CARDINAL NEWMAN'S stooping gait, GARIBALDI'S half closing of the eyes, or VICTOR EMMANUEL'S toss of the head. So I noticed the first finger and thumb drawn together to emphasize a note, or the fingers doubled up, then lifted in a peculiar manner, with a gentle sweep in the middle of a phrase things in which those are determined to be like the master who can be like him in nothing else ; also the peculiar repercussion resonance, since reduced to something like a science by RUBINSTEIN, and the caressing touch, which seemed to draw the soul of the piano out of it almost before the finger reached the key-board. When LISZT passed silently to op. 48, he arrived at some stiff bravura passages, which called forth his old vigour. Yet here all was perfect; not a note slurred over or missed; the old thunder woke beneath his outstretched hands; the spirits of the vasty deep were as obedient as ever to their master's call. With the last chord he rose abruptly; abruptly we came out of the dim, enchanted land of dreams; the common light of day was once more around me.",1880-uu-uu,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/018c7131fa6360859fb7a7b2b1a27e2a,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/9ed543d407f41a3f1d391cc17414d015/1438006352929,Indoor Solitary Domestic,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hugh_Reginald_Haweis,Hugh Reginald Haweis,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Piano,

However, I must get back to the morning when I took my song, “Ich habe gelebt und geliebt,” to the great conductor [Herr Hans Richter]. I think, indeed I am almost certain, that Edith Santley accompanied me to his house. She sang it splendidly, and I need hardly say I fully realised that he was far more likely to be favourably impressed if he heard her sing it than if I merely played it.

Well-known musicians came from distant parts of the country to be present. It was to do honor to the illustrious violinist whom he had known long years that my own venerable master made the journey from the metropolis—to witness the bestowal upon him of a distinction similar to that which had already been conferred upon himself as the inventor of the laryngoscope.

Anticipating this, our company, consisting of three persons, went a little before the time appointed for the opening of the door; but yet we found a crowd gathered; the room filled immediately as the door was opened, but we succeeded in obtaining good seats. We had now to wait a full hour before the music commenced, but in the midst of such a multitude of good-looking and well-dressed ladies and gentlemen, all in conversation in loud and merry voices, it soon passed away. Half an hour before the commencement, the oboe was heard, running the scales, &amp;c.; this was soon followed by faggotti, corni, clarionetti, and strings; every man tuning and getting his instrument and his fingers in readiness. Mendelssohn seemed to look down from his bust immediately opposite the orchestra with approbation. At half-past six precisely, Kapelmeister Rietz takes his stand — the signal is given — every one is silent and attentive, and Beethoven’s overture (op. 124) fills the whole company with delight. This is a very pleasing overture; it is less learned, but of a more popular character than most of Beethoven’s. It is often marked with a rhythm like the music of the march or dance; and the flourishes of the brass instruments and drums almost lead one to suppose that he is listening to a military band. But still the hand of the master is seen, and although Beethoven comes down and freely holds conversation with the people, yet he always preserves his dignity, and never dishonors his profession in this pleasing composition.
A very good singer followed; Frau Leopoldine Tuczek-Herrenburg, from Berlin, in a Recitative and Arie from the opera of “Sylvana,” by C. Maria von Weber.
This was followed by a grand Concerto for the Piano Forte, with orchestral accompaniment (G moll), composed by J. Moschelles, and played by Clara Schumann. I have already spoken of Madame Schumann’s playing; her performance of this Concerto was perfect, and received the warmest approbation from the audience.
An air of De Beriot followed, by Frau Tuczek-Herrenburg; after which Madame Schumann played most charmingly a Notturno (B. major) for piano forte, by F. Chopin. In this she was encored, and played in answer to the call another piece unknown to the writer.
The second part of the concert was that in which the musical ones were most deeply interested, for it consisted of Robert Schumann's new Symphonie. This has not been published, and was played from manuscript, conducted by the author, who was cordially greeted on his appearance at the head of the orchestra. It is undoubtedly a work of great merit; but it is truly a great work, and can only be performed by a very thoroughly trained band. Its analogies and correspondencies are deeper and more hidden than in Mozart or Beethoven, but nevertheless they are there, and can be discovered to some extent even at a first hearing. The Symphonie consists of five movements, there being in addition to the usual movements a short adagio (fourth) introduced. In the second movement (scherzo), there is playfulness and relief, but throughout the whole the idea of greatness prevails; so much so as almost to oppress one with a feeling of grandeur and sublimity. The fourth movement especially seems to partake in the highest degree of this character, and stirs up the deep feelings to awe and reverence. But vain is any attempt at description, especially by one who has heard it but at a single performance. It was played with great energy; every member of the orchestra had enough to do. The captain inspired confidence, and the result was most satisfactory. There was but a momentary pause between the parts, and in this respect the learned conductor’s example is well worthy of imitation. The Symphonie occupied thirty-three minutes in its performance, and at half-past eight the concert closed.",http://data.open.ac.uk/time/interval/1852-03-uuT18:30:00/to/1852-03-uuT20:30:00,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/0a19459865ed69275723d6efb76048c9,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/6eefd1595ac5ecf1d6cc5168421ab33a/1448310300139,Indoor Accompanied Public,http://musicbrainz.org/artist/f422b99a-b48c-4bee-bc0c-f2e8cad82b6c#_,Dr. Lowell Mason Lowell Mason,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Piano,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nocturne

In April, 1848, an orchestra which held together six years came to this country, and became quite famous, the aforementioned Germania Musical Society. It numbered about thirty artists, Mr. Lenschow being the leader. They played much classic music, their “crack piece” being the Midsummer Night's Dream overture. The orchestra was made up of genuine, fine artists, among them Mr. William Schultze, who became the first violin of the Mendelssohn Quintette on the retirement of August Fries in 1859.",1848-04-uu,,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/68b04bd26a005fa87f44cba83160a4ac/1450194952132,Domestic Indoor Accompanied,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Thomas+Ryan/1448997315048,Thomas Ryan,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Violin,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_music

Very early in the year it was enlivened by the excitement arising from a performance for the benefit of the ""Distressed Irish."" A committee of ladies met daily at my rooms in the Theatre, and co-operated with me in the arrangements for this beneficent performance. The proceeds, amounting to about £2000, were handed over to Lord John Russell, then Home Secretary, for distribution in Ireland; and the ladies forming the committee sent me a letter expressing their thanks for my kindness, and for the assistance afforded to them in the conduct of the affair; signed by Lady Palmerston, Lady Clarendon, Lady Clanricarde, and Lady Ailesbury. On the evening of the benefit ""All London"" was present, from the Queen and Royal Family to the humblest inhabitant of the world of fashion who could find a corner in the vast assemblage.

To my great surprise, this noted organist politely but firmly insisted upon my trying the qualities of the instrument before he himself displayed them. This unusual proceeding was afterwards explained to me as being his usual plan for testing a man, for finding that his time had been too often wasted upon men whose acquaintance with music and organs was very limited, and who generally mistook enthusiasm for knowledge, the Professor was compelled to adopt some scheme, whereby he might be enabled to judge of his visitors’ musical capabilities. After complying with his request and playing for a short time, the rightful owner of the organist’s seat took his place, and for one hour greatly delighted me with his performance on the instrument. The selection comprised Bach’s grand Prelude and Fugue in B minor ; Louis Thiele’s air and elaborate variations in A flat; some variations of his own on a chorale ; and a short improvisation. The salient features of his playing were more especially exhibited in the Fugue of Bach’s, played as it was with remarkable dignity and grandeur of style—at a speed too, considerably slower than that usually adopted by the majority of modern English organists. Never, indeed, much of Sebastian Bach’s organ music as I have heard played by the most noted English organists, did I enjoy the music of the grand old Leipzig cantor so thoroughly ; never did I hear this stupendous creation of his fertile brain developed with a more masterly appreciation of its varied beauties, subtle harmonies, and erudite counterpoint.

In the autumn of 1882 Gounod came to England to conduct the first performance of his fine sacred work, “The Redemption”. He was no stranger to London. One of the refugees of 1870, he had made a stay there of considerable duration, and among other pieces brought out his cantata “Gallia”, which he conducted at the opening of the Royal Albert Hall in 1871. Even previous to this, however, he had sketched his design for the work which he labeled “Opus vitae meae,"" and there is ample evidence that he spent, from first to last, upward of a dozen years upon the score of “The Redemption."" Having arranged with Messrs. Novello &amp; Co. for its publication (at the highest price ever paid at that time for an oratorio), Gounod arrived late in September to superintend the final rehearsals for its production at the Birmingham Festival. This was the last of the Midland gatherings over which Sir Michael Costa presided, and I owed to him the honor of a personal introduction to the composer of “Faust” who was then sixty-four years of age. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Gounod was one of the most fascinating men I have ever spoken with. His manner had a charm that was irresistible, and his kindly eyes, soft and melting as a woman's, would light up with a smile, now tender, now humorous, that fixed itself ineffaceably upon the memory. He could speak English fairly well, but preferred his own language, in which he was a brilliant conversationalist; and he could use to advantage a fund of keen, ready wit. He was influenced at that time by a recrudescence of that religious mysticism which had so strongly characterized his youthful career; but his tone, though earnest and thoughtful when he was dwelling upon his art, could brighten up with the lightness and gaiety of a true Parisian. He was rather upset, on the morning of the London band rehearsal at St. George's Hall, by the numerous mistakes in the parts, which led to frequent stoppages. The trouble reached a climax in the “March to Calvary,"" where, after about the ninth or tenth stop, Gounod turned to Costa and remarked: “Seulement ici puis-je pardonner tous ces arrets, quoiqu'ils gatent ma musique.” 
“Pourquoi cela?"" inquired Sir Michael. 
“Parceque,"" replied Gounod, ”a ce point il y a douze stations, et a chaque station il faut naturellement un arret”.
After all the typographical and other errors had been rectified, the march was tried through again and went so magnificently as to arouse the master's undisguised admiration, which deepened with astonishment when Costa informed him that the instrumentalists had never seen a note of the music until that morning. Gounod said to me later, “They are wonderful readers, these English players. There is scarcely a mistake that is due to inaccurate deciphering of the notes. And what makes it even more remarkable is that my work is so full of awkward chromatic progressions.”",1882-uu-uu,,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/0b6a1468d291ef493308baeee9af0ca4/1438251370931,Indoor Accompanied Public,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Hermann+Klein/1438157240872,Hermann Klein,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oratorio

In this respect the Berlin celebration of Dr. Joachim 's jubilee was, of course, far more interesting. Then a grand concert was given, at which every member of the orchestra was a former &nbsp;student of the Hochschule, every individual fiddler a pupil of the ""King of Violinists”; while, to make things perfect, the hero &nbsp;of the night was ultimately persuaded to take his violin and bow &nbsp;from three of his fair musical children and delight his excited &nbsp;auditors with a solo by Bach. I went over expressly to attend &nbsp;that unique and brilliant function. The orchestra was directed &nbsp;by Herr Steinbach, and as long as I live I shall never forget the magnificent quality of the tone of those violins or the superb&nbsp;elan that marked the performance of Weber's ""Euryanthe"" &nbsp;overture. Every player was an artist of repute, and the total &nbsp;value of the stringed instruments was computed at a quarter of&nbsp;a million dollars.

That has happened to music in Italy, which happens to language and style, to poetry and painting, and indeed to every thing else in this world. When a certain point of perfection has been attained, the progress afterwards is in a contrary direction; and a corruption of taste is introduced by the very attempt to pursue improvement beyond that line, which limits all human exertion by the irreversible fiat;—"" thus far shalt thou go, and no farther."" But though music must be considered as on the decline in Italy, there is, notwithstanding, a general diffusion of musical taste and musical talent, extending to the lowest ranks. I have often set my window open at night to listen to the ""dying falls"" of a favourite air, distributed into parts, and sung by a party of mechanics returning home from their work, with a degree of skill and science that would not have disgraced professional performers. The serenade is a compliment of gallantry, by no means confined to the rich. It is customary for a lover, even of the lowest class, to haunt the dwelling of his mistress chanting a rondo, or roundelay, during the period of his courtship.

No; in Parsifal all is solemn, or all is irreverent. At Bayreuth we came on a pilgrimage; it cost us time, and trouble, and money; we were in earnest so were the actors; the spirit of the great master who had planned every detail seemed still to preside over all; the actors lived in their parts; not a thought of self remained; no one accepted applause or recall; no one aimed at producing a personal effect; the actors were lost in the drama, and it was the drama and not the actors which had impressed and solemnised us.

Nay, upon the sudden announcement of an inopportune ""indisposition"" on the part of Madame Grisi, only a few minutes before the commencement of the opera, and actually after the doors were opened, she rendered good service to the management by undertaking the part of Norma at so short a notice.

At that same rehearsal Gounod did an unusual amount of singing. The solo vocalists comprised what the new critic of the “Times” Dr. Francis Hueffer, was then fond of describing as the “representative English quartet”— Albani, Patey, Edward Lloyd, and Santley; nor have I forgotten how exquisitely William H. Cummings (now principal of the Guildhall School of Music, London) delivered the touching phrase allotted to the Penitent Thief. But, as a matter of fact, Gounod, with his sympathetic voix de compositeur, was singing more or less all through the rehearsal, wisely exercising his rare faculty for impressing his exact ideas upon the interpreters of his music.

The Episcopal Church service is used, as it is in most of the Wesleyan congregations. The psalms were read by the minister, and intoned by the Precentor and others of the congregation, making a disagreeable mixture of&nbsp;speech and song. It was so likewise with other parts of the service, as the Lord's Prayer and the Creed. Four metrical hymns were sung, mostly to wretched tunes, and in a wretched manner. A small choir of boys surrounded the Precentor, but there was no organ. Next to me sat a young man who seemed to try and do his best, and the poor fellow would have done pretty well had the tunes been adapted to the circumstances;&nbsp;but when they went up as high as F or G, alas for him! He made the attempt indeed, which is better than not to try at all, but he fell; the leap was beyond his power. He tried to take the high parts of the tune an octave lower than the proper pitch, but in these attempts he often turned somersets, though he did&nbsp;not always come down upon his feet. It was really pitiable to stand by him and witness his efforts; but yet the easier parts of the tune he would get right. From this example, we obtained sufficient proof of what Congregational tunes ought to be: simple and easy, so that they may be within the reach of all. St. Ann, Phuvah, Tallis, are good examples, (Cantica Laudis, p. 307.) Yet they need not all be of this rhythmic character; Olmutz, Hamburg, Marlow, are always good. Had one of these tunes been sung at the Wesleyan Chapel, the young man would have been saved from many falls and bruises.&nbsp;",1852-Ll-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/London,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/7a2a7764a46aaa918bbb0e180be7a664/1461671179750,Public Accompanied Indoor,http://musicbrainz.org/artist/f422b99a-b48c-4bee-bc0c-f2e8cad82b6c#_,Dr. Lowell Mason Lowell Mason,Performance,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/thing/congregation,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_music

A few days later I set Sully Prudhomme’s beautiful words, “Ne jamais la voir ni l’entendre.” This time I was far more excited; it was a very much better song [than author’s setting of Byron’s “ Farewell, if ever fondest prayer.”], and I gave it to one of my cousins to try over. She had a soprano voice and sang with a good deal of dramatic feeling. The melody I had composed was broad and flowing, and there was something in the song that made it possible for a singer to “let himself go” in it. I was almost beside myself with joy when I heard her sing it for the first time. She threw herself into the spirit of the words and sang the music with real passion, as she has sung many a song of mine since then.",187u-Ee-uu,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/bc180dbc583491c00f8a1cd134f7517b,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/2fa087c368aa2522292cd2b4166cd5b7/1450875537436,Indoor Domestic Accompanied,http://musicbrainz.org/artist/eca4d562-1e5c-409a-89fa-5489d102cdcb#_,Maude V.

In the evening to the Opera. Venice is the land of late hours: the scene in St. Mark's Place at midnight is more gay and animated than at any hour of the day; and it is after the opera that evening parties and conversazioni commence. The Gondoliers no longer sing the verses of Tasso; but you are frequently regaled with beautiful music from parties of dilettanti musicians. I ought to record, as an instance of the obliging civility of the Italians, that I met a serenading party in a Gondola to-night, singing very beautifully to their guitars the songs of a favourite opera. Supposing they were professional people, and under the idea that I was to make them a recompense, I detained them half an hour; and it was not till they explained their refusal of any remuneration, that I found it was a nobleman's family returning from an excursion to Padua.",1818-05-28TLl:ll:ll,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Venice,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/39fc381454adc499b2af0d49d7754a4d/1518782874882,Indoor Public Outdoor,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Henry+Matthews/1518777337226,Henry Matthews,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice http://dbpedia.org/resource/Guitar,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

The only important novelty was Frederic Cowen's “Harold” a four-act dramatic opera, composed to a weak libretto by Sir Edward Malet, and, mirabile dictu, sung in English before a Covent Garden audience in mid-season! The fine music of this work deserved more enduring success. The cast comprised Mme. Albani, Miss Meisslinger, Philip Brozel, David Bispham, and Richard Green ; but, unluckily, there was a lack of distinction (and distinctness) about the general rendering that was scarcely calculated to engender in aristocratic auditors any particular love of opera in the vernacular.",1895-uu-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Covent_Garden,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/e5bf21a8c8a6c0fe2f0f19438d1c029a/1438591682407,Accompanied Public Indoor,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Hermann+Klein/1438157240872,Hermann Klein,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

They are held in a somewhat smaller room, and at a small subscription price, and are given only once in two weeks. The orchestra consists of about sixty talented musicians, and if Dreyschock and David are not seen leading the violins here as at the Gewandhaus, they, together with the other instruments, string and wind, are in the hands of artists of deservedly high reputation. The selections are also of the highest order, and the Euterpe presents its patrons with the works of the great masters in a style worthy of a Leipzig concert.
At a quarter of an hour before the time of commencement, the members of the orchestra were in their places, talking, tuning and getting ready. This, together with the general conversation of the people assembled, produces a buzzing chorus of great power — a chorus with which the Leipzig concerts commence. Every ticket was sold at an early hour, and of course every seat was occupied.
The concert commenced precisely at the hour appointed, with a new Sinfonie in E flat Major, in manuscript, by W. Westmayer, who conducted the performance. He is a young candidate for fame, who has been educated at the Conservatory here, and who is regarded as already a successful composer. The Sinfonie consisted of four parts, and occupied in its performance exactly thirty-eight minutes. I dare not attempt anything like a particular description of it, or comparison of it with other like compositions; it was listened to with good attention by a discriminating audience, and met a favorable reception. It seemed to me, however, to want light and shade, and variety in the treatment of the different subjects introduced. Parts of it were exceedingly interesting, considered in reference to modern combinations and contrasts of the different orchestral elements, but there was a too constant forte, and a too frequent reiteration of the tonic and dominant harmony, with brass instruments, in military rhythm — this, indeed, is a general resort of such composers as are sometimes at a loss for an idea, or in a similar condition with the public speaker who is obliged to speak, but has nothing in particular to say. I do not mean that Mr. Westmayer was minus thought, but still there was not such a flow as we often find in a Mozart.
The Sinfonie was truly good, and seemed to give much satisfaction — and yet I could not help thinking that it was an excellent preparation for the high appreciation of the next orchestral piece, which was no less an overture than the celebrated No. 2, C Major, to Leonore, and which was given with an effect far beyond what can be often heard.
The overture by C. M. Von Weber, to Oberon, was also played with such an energy and brilliancy as to take one’s breath away. The stillness of the pianos, the gradual and immense range of the crescendos, the thundering power of the fortes, with instantaneous contrasts and startling sfortzandos, were enough to work up the feelings to a perfect phrenzy. Wonderfully effective were these ever favorite overtures by Beethoven and Weber.
It was no small attraction of this concert that the piano forte was played by the Fraulein Maria Wieck, the sister of the celebrated Clara, wife of Robert Schumann. Mdlle. Wieck is a very superior player; she has not the strong hand of a DeMeyer or a Listz, but she has a most finished touch, and plays with great elegance and expression. Her first piece (hear it, oh ye of the exclusive modern school,) was nothing more nor less than Dussek’s 12th Concerto in E fiat major, the Adagio and Allegro movements of which she played — a most beautiful composition, elegant and tasteful in the highest degree, played both by the principal and by the orchestra as near perfection as such things can be done. There is nothing in the music to astonish, or to excite wonder or surprise, but there is that in it which is adapted to call forth perfect delight. It is full of peace, and innocence, and purity, and joy, and it is from beginning to end a constant appeal to the perception of the beautiful. I am no enemy to the modem school; it is indispensable to an accomplished pianist, and every well-educated musician will delight in it; but they err who suppose that in Clementi and Cramer and Dussek and Pleyel, there is nothing good or worth being saved. The fact is, the pianists, previous to him who is generally regarded as the head of the great modern school, had worked out a very satisfactory solution of the problem of piano forte playing, or certainly so if considered with reference to the more natural and legitimate powers of the instrument. Thaiberg, Listz, and others, have certainly much enlarged the boundaries, or the available capacities of the piano, but some of their followers have gone to extremes; so much so that there has seemed to be danger of losing altogether the ordinary effects of piano forte playing, or that they would he swallowed up in the extraordinary feats of left-hand melodies, flights of octaves, and the various methods by which amazement and wonder are excited. Thanks for the signs of returning soberness and good sense; we greatly mistake if other authors like Dussek are not yet to be brought back to the concert room, and to the parlor, to fill with delight the spirit of the true lover of music, and of the most beautiful of all keyed instruments, the piano forte.
A word to another class. There are some who condemn altogether the modern school, and who seem to suppose that all true musical genius left the world with Haydn and those of his day. Fraulein Wieck is not of their number, for while she played Dussek, in the first part of the concert, she played not Thalberg, or Listz, or DeMeyer in the second part, but Pagannini! Yes, the Carnival of Venice, arranged for the piano, and if music pleased legitimately in Dussek, the Fraulein excited no small degree of feeling by her exquisite touch, and facility of execution in the composition of the Prince of violinists. What if it be mere trickery; a dexterous artifice will always, at least, call forth admiration, and one does not always want to sit in sober judgment; and decide on the grounds of intrinsic musical merit — relaxation must be indulged, the beautiful give way to the ornamental, and true pleasure to mere amusement. If there is a time for all things, surely there is room enough for the old and new school of piano forte playing — yes, and for both schools of organ playing too, although this is not the place to dwell upon the latter.
There was still another interesting feature in the Euterpe&nbsp;Concert — it was the singing of Mdlle. Louise Wolfl. She sang an air from Stradella by Flotow, and also two German songs, the latter by Franz Schubert. A pretty singer, but not superior to several American vocalists.",1852-01-Mm,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leipzig,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/7330645c2870c672bd778f6224329f82/1448276928580,Public Accompanied Indoor,http://musicbrainz.org/artist/f422b99a-b48c-4bee-bc0c-f2e8cad82b6c#_,Dr. Lowell Mason Lowell Mason,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra http://dbpedia.org/resource/Piano,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Concerto

The delight which the King experienced, he knew not how to give vent to more royally than by expressing a desire to see the tragedy completely performed, the success of which, on the Berlin stage, with the splendid compositions of Mendelssohn, was considerable, and yet not such as to silence the opposition of a critical and gainsaying public, which, instead of beholding in the performance the gratification of artistic taste on the part of the King, was resolved to believe in a design to regulate or school the general taste by authority. At a later period, the 'Oedipus at Colonos ' (the Choruses by Taubert) was performed with good effect, and by the desire of the King, under Bunsen's direction, the great works of Aeschylus (the 'Agamemnon,' the 'Eu menides,' the 'Choephorae') were compressed by Professor Franz into one piece, called the ' Oresteia.' It was hoped that Mendelssohn would have undertaken the arrangement and musical composition of the Choruses, but after much consideration, for reasons indicated in the second volume of his published correspondence, he was obliged to leave the royal wish unfulfilled.'",,,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/http://data.open.ac.uk/led/music/Oresteia/1434012771667/1434012771684,Indoor Accompanied,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/King+of+Prussia/1375807441992 http://dbpedia.org/resource/Christian_Charles_Josias_von_Bunsen,"King of Prussia Christian Charles Josias, Baron von Bunsen Baron von Bunsen Christian Karl Josias von Bunsen Christian Charles Josias von Bunsen",Performance,,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Incidental_music

1. Quintet, G minor, Mozart.
Allegro, Adagio, Minuet, Finale.

Here was a programme worth one’s attention, whether the compositions, or the performers be considered. It was interesting to see such artists taking subordinate parts, that the compositions might be as perfectly rendered as possible. It is needless to add that the result did not disappoint expectation. This was the last concert of the Union for the season. Sixteen performances have been given; eight evening concerts, and eight subscription matinees. The Union have secured the very best artists; and three Italians, two Hungarians, two Bohemians, two Belgians, one Bavarian, three Prussians, one Austrian, one Frenchman, and five Englishmen, have been employed.

The conductor was Robert Schumann himself; the pianist was his wife. The orchestra was large, and the best that Leipzig could furnish. Robert Schumann has great celebrity, and especially in those cities where he has resided and has brought out his music under his own immediate direction. No one since Mendelssohn’s death stands so high in the estimation of the German musicians. There are places where he is not known, because his music is not understood; but even in these, and throughout Germany, he is regarded as standing at the very head of his profession, and no one commands aa. he does the universal attention of scientific men. Some go so far as to regard him as the greatest symphonist that has ever lived; but time can only determine this.
The concert had been advertised for some time, and the expectations of the lovers of music were fully awake. Not only were the musicians and lovers of music of Leipzig present, but literary and scientific men of the various professions, and the beauty, and wealth, and fashion of the city came to do homage to talent of so high an order, and to learning so extensive. Like the people at Lystra, so here, they lifted up their voices, saying, not in the speech of Lycaonia, but in that of Saxony ""The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men.”&nbsp;
[...]
But it was not only from this city that the audience was gathered on this occasion; it had been noised abroad that this concert was to be given, and musical men of high standing, Kapellmeisters and Concertmeisters, from the region round about, came up to Leipzig. Berlin, Dresden, Weimar, and other places were represented. At the head of this foreign company, and indeed at the head of the whole company, was Lis[zt];— the very Lis[zt] himself came from Weimar to listen, and to pay honor to greatness. But Robert Schumann is not alone, he has a “help meet” indeed. Clara Wieck was perhaps the most distinguished female pianist who has ever lived; and, unlike many ladies, she did not give up her instrument when she became Clara Schumann, but rather devoted herself with greater assiduousness under her new instructor, than she had previously done under the teachings of her father, to the profession which had been the choice of both her husband and herself. No wonder that the people should assemble on the occasion of a visit from this far-famed couple. But they came not to hear any one sing or play on an instrument, for although the wife is indeed a most accomplished pianist, yet the husband neither plays nor sings; but they rather came to hear the new music that the master had produced. They looked for some new musical revelation, for new chords (if possible), or new progressions; at least some new method of treatment, or harmonic development was expected. It was not to be the same tune over again. They went away satisfied; for, not only was the musical performance pronounced to be one of the very best, but the music, or the principal piece of attraction, was regarded as worthy of its author.
The first piece was the “Overture zu L. Byron's Manfred&nbsp;von R. Schumann,"" This is an overture in the true learned German style, and as unlike the overtures of the modem Italian and French schools as can be imagined; of course, it cannot be popular, that is, it cannot take with the people generally; on this occasion, however, it was fully appreciated and listened to, by one of the most intelligent musical audiences that could be brought together in Germany, with unmingled delight. The second piece was “Concert No. 2, F moll, fur Piano Forte mit Begleitung des or Chester, von F. Chopin,” performed by Clara Schumann. This is said to be in Chopin’s peculiar style, and one of his most difficult productions. Mad. Schumann played it with apparent ease, and with a delicacy of touch and distinctness of articulation not to be excelled. She has not so great a power as some; in this respect she resembles Chopin himself, but in everything else requisite to the perfection of piano forte playing she is fully accomplished. The third piece was a song by Herr Behr, necessary for variety’s sake; after which Mad. Schumann played most charmingly two pieces- “Andantino von W. Sterndale Bennett"" and ""Lied ohne Worte (F major), von F. Mendelssohn Bartholdy.”
The second part of the concert (and here was the attraction) consisted of “Die Pilgerfahrt der Rose” (the pilgrimage of the rose), a new composition for voices (solo and chorus) and orchestra by Robert Schumann. This has been performed here a week or two before, and was noticed in a previous communication. Anything like an analytical notice of it from one who has heard it but once or twice would hardly be expected, and in the present case it would be quite absurd. It will be known in a few years. The orchestra never played better; the idea of playing under Schumann inspired every man with new life and energy, and the improvement in the performance of the music under the direction of the composer (there having been a previous rehearsal also under his teaching), was said to be very apparent. We can hardly imagine a musical occasion that would be more interesting or exciting especially to the truly enlightened musician than this. For the few details here given we are indebted to others, for we did not attend this concert; we neither saw the sight nor heard the sound thereof. Why? It was given on Sunday Morning, March 14th, at 11 o'clock.",http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/day/1852-03-14,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/0a19459865ed69275723d6efb76048c9,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/88d5b41643d275be8818ae38455b87e3/1448285426287,Accompanied Indoor Public,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Franz+Liszt/1424794451085 http://musicbrainz.org/artist/f422b99a-b48c-4bee-bc0c-f2e8cad82b6c#_,Franz Liszt Dr. Lowell Mason Lowell Mason,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Choir http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Symphonic_poem

The next great event, and one which brought my first season through all its difficulties and dangers to a successful conclusion, was the reappearance of the great tenor Rubini, He was announced for a limited number of nights only, previous to his final retirement from the stage. The intense desire to hear the last notes of this long-established favorite of the frequenters of the opera, brought crowded houses, during every one of his performances, which commenced on the 13th of June, until the end of the season. In the ""Sonnambula,"" in ""Don Giovanni,"" in the ""Puritani,"" in the ""Matri- monio Segreto,"" in ""Anna Bolena,"" in ""Otello,"" in ""Cosi Fan Tutti,"" and in his favourite air from the ""Pirata"" (given on the nights when he did not appear in a whole opera), sung with an embroidery as delicate as Mechlin lace — in all these parts he was listened to with rapture, up to his final farewell.

Don’t you remember how she lingered on that note?” Or, “Try and make that finale sound as if there were a crowd of people singing,” etc. etc. And I took to this Italian operatic music like a duck to water. There was something emotional in it that appealed to the youth in me, and I loved to try and make the piano a living and breathing human voice. That my playing of these scores gave real pleasure to someone very dear to me was in itself a powerful incentive. Perhaps the actual music only stirred me on the surface - still, even surfaces are facts that cannot be denied, and have to be reckoned with. And I adored, with every reason, the really beautiful singing I heard so constantly; my love of vocal music grew apace, and in my admiration for the singer I often failed to detect the flimsy quality of the music.",18Mm-uu-uu,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/bc180dbc583491c00f8a1cd134f7517b,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/6bdcb760f2238253ed504e1d86fe6f8c/1476550950821,Domestic Accompanied Indoor,http://musicbrainz.org/artist/eca4d562-1e5c-409a-89fa-5489d102cdcb#_,Maude V.

On the evening I followed the usual custom of the musical people of Dresden, and went to the Opera-house, a huge temporary wooden building, capable of seating three thousand persons, erected shortly after the lamentable fire at the late splendid Opera-house, which was totally destroyed. The prices of admission varied from 3s. 6d. to 9d., the house being so constructed that everyone could both hear and see well. I had a front stall in the parquette, immediately in front of the stage and orchestra, and I was delighted to find on receiving a pro­gramme that my long wished for opportunity of hearing one of Wagner's most popular operas in Germany was now to be gratified. We were to have the “Meister-singer,” and it was certainly put upon the stage and performed most effectively. The orchestra consisted of about sixty performers, directed by that able musician and composer Dr. Julius Reitz, Mendelssohn’s friend. Whether from the intense heat and the want of proper ventilation in the building, or from the want of repose, variety and relief in the music, I was quite overcome at the end of the first act, and was compelled to return to my hotel—perhaps a wiser, if not a sadder man. Undoubtedly Wagner’s instrumenta­tion is the work of a master, and not for one moment does he apparently allow the performers to indulge in the luxury of a few bars rest. Nearly every instrument in the orchestra seemed to have an obbligato part, and all were playing at one and the same time. It was impossible to catch more than the ghost or fragment of a tune. No sooner did the ear find a snatch of pretty melody when it instantly gave place to another equally brief; every conceivable device seemed to be employed to render every subject peculiar and fragmentary, and yet undoubtedly many of the dramatic situations were powerful and effective. Especially interesting was the opening portion of the opera at the conclusion of the singular and overwrought overture. Here the scene in the church, the groupings, and never ceasing action of two or three score of people on the stage, undoubtedly excite lively interest, and seemed to be highly and fully appreciated by the composer’s numerous admirers, who were present in full force, and some of whom did their best to impress upon my mind the sublime superiority of this and other Wagnerian effusions over the master-pieces of those great musicians whom either my education or my prejudices had taught me to esteem the highest.

&nbsp;
Close to the Conservatorium is the “ S. Thomas Schule,” part of which was once the house of Sebastian Bach, and in the gardens beneath it stands his statue. Deeply interested, I walked under the windows of the large, tall, quaint old building, and eventually found myself gazing at the statue of the most profound musician, the deepest thinker, the hardest worker of all the world’s musical heroes. “ Listen,” I said to my friend, “listen, the choir are singing one of the dear old Cantor’s motets,” as I recognized at once that splendid eight-part unaccompanied work in G Minor: [...] With the greatest firmness, accuracy, and in strict time by a choir of boys and men, was the piece sung, but interrupted occasionally, for I could hear everything distinctly, by the remarks of Dr. Richter, who caused the difficult passages to be sung again and again, until they were delivered perfectly.

On one memorable occasion Rubinstein and Wieniawski did me the honor to spend an evening at my house in Boston. A right royal musical evening it was, shared by about fifty artist and amateur guests. We made much music,—beginning with Rubinstein’s String Quintette in F, op. 57. Then we had the Rasoumoffski Quartette in F, op. 57, by Beethoven, with Wieniawski playing first violin. Then the Schumann Piano Quintette, with Rubinstein at the piano. Oh, it was a joy to take part with such a man and in such a work! and how Rubinstein did spur us on by his passionate way of playing some of the great parts! his power was fierce and tremendous. I think we all revelled in the sea of sound we made about us.
After the Quintette, Rubinstein played a lot of choice solo pieces, ending the evening with the Chopin Polonaise in A flat, op. 53, in which comes the wonderful passage for the left hand in octaves. He began the phrase very soft, then the “little-by-little crescendo” was most admirably done, finally reaching a fortissimo power which was quite colossal. It stirred us all up, and set even the chandelier to jingling in sympathy, and possibly in admiration.",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boston,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/ace92a7e486ec68f31a8fc271ffa360f/1449477783993,Domestic Indoor Accompanied,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Thomas+Ryan/1448997315048,Thomas Ryan,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Piano,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_music

A principal point of attraction is always found in the Symphony, and on this occasion it was not a Mozart, a Beethoven, or a Mendelssohn, but an original manuscript composition of a member of the Orchestra, Ferd. Hermann, that was performed. Herr Hermann directed his own Symphony. It did not meet with a very warm reception, though sufficiently so to afford good encouragement to the author and his friends. There is always so much caution and incredulity, and sometimes suspicion, envy and jealousy abroad, that the path to&nbsp;fame, even to true merit, is rough and beset with difficulties.
Our author, we suppose, could not complain of the manner in which his work was received, and probably a young composer does not often obtain greater approbation. There were undoubtedly fine points in the Symphony, indicating talent, taste and judgment. Its themes were concise and clear, and there seemed to be a considerable degree of the effusion of genuine feeling, without dry detail, commonplace thoughts, or tedious repetitions. The instrumentation was quite well balanced, though the Oboe was, perhaps, somewhat too prominent in the melodic passages; a greater variety of coloring in this respect might be an improvement. The thoughts were easy, natural and chaste, but yet never so striking as to call forth a rapturous or involuntary exclamation of delight or applause. The interest too was well sustained through the four movements, and although we suppose that the critics will not allow to this Symphony a higher place than mediocrity, yet the young author may be well contented with the award bestowed, return to his study, and try again.
Signor Stigelli, a Tenor, from the Royal Italian Opera, London, sang with approbation; Carl Deichmann, a Violinist, from Hanover, played with entire success, a Concerto, by Vieux Temps; an aria by Julius Rietz, (Conductor,) was charmingly sung by Miss Mayer, coming seemingly fresh from the heart, on the tones of a sweet voice.

His father was a clergyman, with a large family and small salary, and though a warm-hearted music lover, was too poor to think of going to hear Jenny Lind. Father and son had read together a long notice of the approaching song-festival in Wheeling, and the father had remarked with a sigh of resignation, “ I wish I could hear her.”
The son determined to try and go to Wheeling for that purpose.

I had no lessons, but was sent to practise by myself for an hour every afternoon on a horrid little upright piano in the dreary dining-room.
&nbsp;
Of course I did nothing of the sort; in the first place, I had nothing to practise, for I certainly had no intention of learning any of the really dreadful drawing-room pieces with which the piano was covered. Occasionally I played through one of them, for I read music quite easily. How I jibbed at the “Prière d’une Vierge”! The “Gems of Scotland,” set in arpeggios and triplets, were sham jewels for which I had unmitigated contempt, and one or two pieces by Brinsley Richards made my flesh creep. I had such frightful attacks of low spirits in that dreary back room that I never think of it without horror. After some months I began to connect music itself with those four walls and those hideous tenth-rate compositions which lay in bilious green and yellow covers on the top of the piano, and it seemed to me that my own love of music was being slowly poisoned to death. So much for atmosphere! When I left Miss Reach’s at the end of the year, I would not have cared if I had never set eyes on a piano again. I almost hated the sight of one.

In this same period the “Yankee singing- school” and the so-called “musical conventions” flourished. The latter were held for years in Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, and Massachusetts. The singers of these different States had organized governing boards that appointed the time of meeting and engaged the music director and assisting artists. The chorus of singers chiefly studied so-called “ sacred music,” and usually wound up their week’s labor with an oratorio performance.
[...]
The evenings of the conventions were generally devoted to mixed music, in which the chorus took part Nearly every oratorio worthy of mention—entire or in part—was thus familiarized to people who lived in the remotest parts of New England.
This little history will account for the possibility of assembling, on occasions like the Gilmore Peace Jubilees, a chorus numbering five to ten thousand singers who were at home in oratorio music.

Jenny Lind appeared in the part which had first ""taken the town by storm,"" — in the part of Alice, in ""Roberto II Diavolo."" But, although the public seemed to care for nothing but Jenny Lind, and although all the interest of the opera centred in the great favourite of the day, that same public appeared to resent the mutilation of Meyerbeer's great work: 1st, by the entire suppression of the character of the Princess Isabella, and 2nd, by the omission of two complete acts. The revival was thus a failure in popular esteem, though not in remunerative attraction; for, as has been said, whenever, and whatever ""Jenny"" sang, the house was crowded to its farthest limits. The ""cast,"" it must be said, lacked the completeness of the previous year, Gardoni (the Raimbaldo of the previous season), favourite though he was, was pronounced not up to the part of Roberto; whilst Beletti, although usually applauded by the.audience in other characters was judged deficient in the depth and intensity necessary to Bertram. Labocetta, the new Raimbaldo, also failed to please.

I felt I wanted to kick over the traces and do something to make the combined hair of the Universe stand straight on end ! Instead of doing that, I began to cry ! I don’t know what possessed me, but I suppose that, after the hours and hours that I had forced myself to work at counterpoint with its cut and dried rules, the lawless, devil-me-care vitality of that gipsy music woke up something in me that has never gone to sleep again, something that will live as long as I have breath, something that made me feel as if my heart and the heart of all humanity had been laid bare to me for a moment, so that I might understand, once and for all, the heights and depths of emotion at white heat, the heights and depths of joy, grief, love - fierce, passionate, demanding all, and giving all magnificently, counting no costs - hate, jealousy, the ecstasy of liberty, the sheer delight in tremendous spaces, vast horizons, the immediate response to the imperious impulse of the moment, whether for good or evil, so that I might understand, in a word, the human heart let loose like a horse on the wild Hungarian puszta, with no guiding light beyond the flaming torch of its own passions - the human heart to whom religion has never made its noble, its equally passionate, but superbly unselfish, appeal !",188u-Ee-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prater,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/76d643458accce0aee6fb985ce276cdb/1476600768904,Accompanied Public,http://musicbrainz.org/artist/eca4d562-1e5c-409a-89fa-5489d102cdcb#_,Maude V.

Gayarre was not a great tenor in the highest sense of the term. Nevertheless, he possessed vocal and histrionic attributes of a very distinguished kind, and chance so willed it that he was destined to ""bridge over” to a large extent the interval that separated the final retirement of Mario from the advent (as a tenor) of Jean de Reszke. By birth a Spaniard, and hailing from Pampeluna (the town in which Sarasate was born), Giuliano Gayarre had studied and won his early successes in Italy. He was an exponent of the new quasi-nasal Thirty Years of school of tenor singers, which already had Tamagno for one of its leading protagonists. To my ears his production, on the night he made his debut at Covent Garden (April 7, 1877), sounded strange and not wholly pleasant. Still, the voice traveled well, and he sang the music of Gennaro with so much tenderness, so much charm, allied to genuine dramatic feeling and expression, that the crowded house forthwith accorded him a splendid reception. I declined to join in the general chorus of “Another Mario!” It struck me as little less than sacrilege to compare with the divine voice of that tenor an organ which could occasionally descend, or ascend, to the utterance of tones that quickly earned the name of the “Gayarre bleat.""&nbsp; ",http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/day/1877-04-09,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Covent_Garden,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/b7b7e27a5114822ecabff6da4a1a39fc/1438248601884,Public Indoor Accompanied,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Hermann+Klein/1438157240872,Hermann Klein,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

It was at Rovigo that I first saw, in Verdi's opera of ""Attila,"" a prima donna whose name afterwards came to be intimately associated with Her Majesty's Theatre, and was at once charmed with the fresh and resonnante voice of Mademoiselle Sophie Cruvelli. Overtures were immediately made to her for an engagement for the ensuing season in London; whereat Sophie Cruvelli was ""in ecstacies.""

A select few had bestowed upon them the insignia of the Royal Victoria Order ; and the first musician to be thus honored, after Sir Arthur Sullivan and Signor Tosti, was M. Jean de Reszke, who received the cross of the “RVO” (fourth class) after a performance of “Lohengrin” at Windsor Castle on the Queen's eightieth birthday. May 24, 1899. His brother was similarly decorated fourteen months later, after a representation of “Faust” — the last occasion on which Queen Victoria ever listened to an opera.
The birthday celebration was marked by one or two curious incidents. To begin with, only the first and third acts of “Lohengrin"" could be given. There was hardly time to include the second, as these royal functions do not commence until nearly ten o 'clock at night. The plot, however, was fully explained to the Queen, who had never heard Wagner 's opera, and the temptation of Elsa (Mme. Nordica) by the perfidious Ortrud (Mme. Schumann- Heink) and her spouse (David Bispham) was easily “taken as read”. Mancinelli conducted, and everything went capitally until the fall of the curtain. Her Majesty then retired to one of the drawing-rooms and requested that the principal artists be presented to her, together with Mr. Maurice Grau as managing director of the Royal Opera. The awful discovery was then made that neither Jean nor Edouard de Reszke had with him any but the operatic garments in which they stood. It was the first time that the brothers had ever appeared in opera before the Queen, and, not knowing that it was usual to don evening dress for the subsequent presentation, they had clothed themselves as Lohengrin and Heinrich der Vogler before leaving London, and had traveled to Windsor in dark cloaks of sufficient amplitude to conceal themselves from the gaze of an inquisitive Cockney crowd. The situation was duly explained to Her Majesty, who laughingly declared that it did not matter in the least; for once court etiquette should be disregarded, and the two artists brought before her in their picturesque stage attire. The command was forthwith obeyed, and the Queen, in course of conversation with the brothers, “expressed the delight that it had afforded her at last to hear them in opera and listen to the beautiful music of Wagner's work”.",http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/day/1899-05-24,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Windsor_Castle,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/b6524ad7dd4e1cb39ef9483aac476168/1438597582307,Accompanied Indoor Domestic,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Queen+Victoria/1393599242108,Queen Victoria,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

A right royal musical evening it was, shared by about fifty artist and amateur guests. We made much music,—beginning with Rubinstein’s String Quintette in F, op. 57. Then we had the Rasoumoffski Quartette in F, op. 57, by Beethoven, with Wieniawski playing first violin. Then the Schumann Piano Quintette, with Rubinstein at the piano. Oh, it was a joy to take part with such a man and in such a work! and how Rubinstein did spur us on by his passionate way of playing some of the great parts! his power was fierce and tremendous. I think we all revelled in the sea of sound we made about us.
After the Quintette, Rubinstein played a lot of choice solo pieces, ending the evening with the Chopin Polonaise in A flat, op. 53, in which comes the wonderful passage for the left hand in octaves. He began the phrase very soft, then the “little-by-little crescendo” was most admirably done, finally reaching a fortissimo power which was quite colossal.

I found him a plain intelligent man, speaking very good English. I could suppose in person he somewhat resembles his great master, Haydn. He laid before me the oratorio of David, just composed by him, which I heard the following day. The choruses are magnificent, but so loaded with the brazen sounds, that they require at least fifty additional stringed instruments to a part, to counterbalance and assuage their terrible roar. There was also an enormous bass instrument, the Ophicleide, procured from Germany. It appeared like a column of brass towering in the band, and required a pair of Stentorian lungs to play upon it. Its lower tones were distinctly heard growling below all the other instruments. The author had, no doubt, preconceived the clamorous effect of a Jewish orchestra, to which the sackbut, shawn, and timbrel imparted a barbaric character. However learned and scientific this work may be, I was more gratified with what little I heard of his 'Mount Sinai.' "" The manner in which the Commandments are delivered at intervals from the holy mountain, in the tones of the ancient ecclesiastical canto fermo, accompanied by the sounds of the brazen instruments, is full of awful grandeur.""

In the afternoon, at [Professor Haupt's] suggestion, I visited the church of S. Marien, a fine building, possessing one of the largest organs in Berlin, ably presided over by Herr Otto Dienel. The service and organ were both similar to those I had heard in the morning; the organ, however, was enclosed in a much handsomer and elaborately carved case. In the evening I went to the recently erected church of S. Thomas, which has an immense dome in the centre, and is most richly and profusely decorated throughout. Here I found a large new instrument of four manuals, built by W. Sauer, of Frankfort-on-the-Oder. The organist is Herr Succo, an admir­able writer of organ music, whose courtesy and kindness demand my warmest acknowledgments. The service began with a grand old chorale in G minor, and was of the same character as those I have mentioned above. After the service, the organist performed a “ Toccata” of his own, and in other pieces displayed the various qualities of the instrument, which was not so fine in the flue work as the older organs, but much superior in reed work and mechanical appliances, the pneumatic lever being amongst the most valuable.",1870-Mm-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Berlin,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/1a24c2600a90bea836739cc8e24a24d5/1465388253361,Indoor Accompanied Public,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Dr+William+Spark/1465384918944,Dr William Spark,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Organ_(music),http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chorale

There are some people whose musical organisation is so fine, and whose instinctive method is so true, that without that stern discipline usually essential to the production of the voice, they have managed to teach themselves how to sing modestly but faultlessly, as far as they go, although not knowing even their notes. Those people will sing you a national ballad with true pathos, and even a certain technical finish, which many a skilled professional might envy. I remember delighting in LORD HEADLEY'S singing, which was of this kind. He lived close to us, in Brunswick Square, and I often heard him after dinner sing his Irish ballads not invariably MOORE, but some wilder still, and some quite unfamiliar to me. He used to throw back his rather large head, and display a very broad white waistcoat; and standing with his two thumbs thrust into the arm- holes of his waistcoat, and his fingers spread out and twitching nervously with emotion, he would pour out his ditty with the truest instinct and often finest pathos. In this, without knowing a note of music, he evidently took exceeding delight himself, and so did we. He who loves the sound of his own voice is not always so fortunate. LORD HEADLEY'S voice was small, flexible, and exquisitely sympathetic, and made me always think of TOM MOORE'S graceful musical declamation of the Irish melodies, which, of course, I had only read about.",,,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/0f900e9c8fbeb350acb16488dd9988bc/1437729917801,Accompanied Domestic Indoor,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hugh_Reginald_Haweis,Hugh Reginald Haweis,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ballad

In 1855, owing to the earnest advocacy of such friends as M. FERDINAND PRAEGER, who for thirty years, through evil report and good report, had never ceased to support WAGNER, the Philharmonic Society invited him over to London, and whilst here he conducted eight concerts. He was not popular; he was surprised to find that the band thought it unnecessary to rehearse, and the band was surprised that he should require so much rehearsal. But he drove the band in spite of itself, and the band hated him. They said he murdered BEETHOVEN with his baton, because of the freedom and inspiration of his readings.

Sivori was still alive, and, like the majority of artists who lead the lives of virtuosi, had made Paris his home. I determined to do myself the honor of calling on him, and had an opportunity to do so in company with a Boston friend who knew him well. Sivori was living on the fourth or fifth story of a very modest hotel, having a single room, with space for an upright piano and an alcove for his bed. It was a charming, cosy little room, just such a one as the majority of bachelor artists occupy in Paris, no matter how ample their income; and in these quarters they receive the visits of princes and people of the haute noblesse.
I let my friend, who was intimate with Sivori, do the talking for some time, while I watched all the artist’s motions. He was a rather small-sized man, and had very small hands for a violinist, at which I marvelled, for his distinction was based on his being a Paganini player; and we all know that the music of that composer requires the fingers of a prestidigitator. As we progressed in our call I nudged my friend (according to previous agreement) to tell Sivori I was a member of the Mendelssohn Quintette Club of Boston, and that I wanted very much to see the famous “ Strad,” the inheritance from Paganini. Sivori was amiability itself.
[…]
Sivori took out the violin from its case. It was a perfect “ Kohinoor ” of an instrument, just the right color, and perfectly preserved,— not a scratch or a crack,—with the great seal of red sealing-wax on the under part of the violin where the neck begins. I told Mr. Sivori that I heard him in his first concert given in the old Masonic Temple in Boston (where R. H. Steams &amp; Co.’s store now is), that I was an enthusiastic boy at the time, and that his playing had made such an impression on me that I could name the pieces he played in that concert, though there was an interim of about forty years. I named them,—the E-flat concerto (his own composition), La Campanile by Paga¬nini, and the Most in Egitto, also by Paganini.
The old artist opened his bookcase, took out a book containing an itinerary of musical tourndes made in his younger days, and turned at once to Boston. I had named the pieces exactly, and he was highly pleased. He played for us a great deal, and it was a joy to hear the tone of that violin; it was also impossible not to be affected by the sentiment connected with it. Paganini’s violin! the instrument of that strange and wonderful player, the wizard of the concert stage, who had conquered all musical Europe",1888-uu-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/995eccc96ace696fff9ba66c3c52c732/1449566749829,Domestic Accompanied Indoor,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Thomas+Ryan/1448997315048,Thomas Ryan,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stradivarius,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_music

D'ALQUEN used to play at CAPTAIN NEWBERRY'S. He got one of his violins when the Captain died. He did a great deal for music in Brighton. He was an admirable musician, an excellent teacher, and a German artist of the solid MOSCHELES type. I was one night at his house when a telegram arrived to say that Sebastopol had at last fallen, and D'ALQUEN sat down to the piano and executed a rather disjointed but murderous improvisation inspired by the siege and ultimate surrender of that redoubtable fortress; the great guns in the bass were continuous and the firing was very heavy. Before midnight another telegram arrived to say that it was all a mistake, and Sebastopol had not fallen. Of course we took no notice, and indeed were rather anxious to conceal the awkward and malaprop intelligence from the worthy Professor. We all felt it was high time Sevastopol did fall, and some time afterwards it fell, and D'ALQUEN'S piano, which had suffered considerably from the cannonade by anticipation, had at last something to show for it.&nbsp; ",1856-uu-uu,,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/6e91f432515d74305d1332f57cffccd8/1437728803299,Indoor Accompanied Domestic,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hugh_Reginald_Haweis,Hugh Reginald Haweis,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Piano,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Musical_improvisation

He had with him his two sons ; and our trading affair being ended, hearing that I was fond of music, he informed me they were violin-players, and proposed to have a trio of Beethoven's in the evening. It was at the Angel Inn that I met them. The father, a large stout man, had a force and breadth of play, a grandeur of style, surpassing everything I had hitherto heard upon the violin [...] His love of music led him to carry his son Francis to Paris, and to place him under Cherubini, to be educated in the musical profession. Henry, who was in business with the father, had been tutored by him upon the violoncello, and was a most accomplished performer. The style of Francis was very different from that of the father ; full of passion, exquisitely neat and delicate. In the 57th quartett of Haydn, the elder Femy impressed a force and brilliancy upon the first bar that was like the rushing of a sky-rocket into the ethereal expanse ; even Yanewick, with all his boldness, would have appeared feeble in his presence. Their combined talents were most skilfully shown in Beethoven's serenade trio; the father playing the tenor, Francis the first, and Henry the bass.

Doyle’s father being a professor of music, he had received regular instructions in the art, and having a very sweet and touching voice, was able to accompany himself on the piano-forte. Kelly, on the other hand, who knew nothing of the science of music, and at that time, indeed, could hardly write his own name, had taken, when quite a youth, to the profession of the stage, and having a beautiful voice and a handsome face and person, met with considerable success. He and Doyle were inseparable companions, and their duets together were the delight of the gay supper-giving society in which they lived.&nbsp; The entertainments of this kind given by my joyous and social mother could, for gaiety at least, match with the best. Our small front and back drawing-rooms, as well as a little closet attached to the latter, were on such occasions distended to their utmost capacity ; and the supper-table in the small closet where people had least room was accordingly always the most merry. In the round of singing that followed these repasts my mother usually took a part, having a clear, soft voice, and singing such songs as “How sweet in the woodlands,” which was one of her greatest favourites, in a very pleasing manner.

Richard Strauss paid his first visit to England in December, 1897. His songs and chamber pieces were tolerably well known, but of his orchestral works only three had so far been heard in London—namely, the symphony in F (April 12) and the symphonic poems, “Till Eulenspiegel” and “Also sprach Zarathustra”. He now brought with him the “Tod und Verklarung”, wherein is depicted the death struggle of a man before whose mental vision there passes the panorama of a wasted life, followed by the man's transfiguration, as his redeemed soul passes out of earthly existence into a higher state. The second section of this remarkable work made an especially deep impression, and at the close the composer was overwhelmed with applause. Strauss's gifts as a conductor were made manifest in very positive fashion. In his own music startling contrasts, powerful crescendos, and exciting climaxes naturally abounded. In the inter-pretation of Mozart and Wagner he displayed an admirable command of dynamic effects, ranging from the most delicate to the most sonorous; and in everything alike he revealed the intellectual insight and authority, the artistic culture, the magnetic force, the strong individuality of a musician of genius.",1897-12-uu,,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/85f29e94ea731018dfce34b928f504f9/1438589705007,Public Accompanied Indoor,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Hermann+Klein/1438157240872,Hermann Klein,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Symphonic_poem

Never shall I forget a performance of Schumann’s E flat quartet that I heard there for the first time and the way they played the divinely tender Andante Cantabile !&nbsp;&nbsp;  I remember feeling as if the heavens had opened when, towards the end of the second movement, the tender, lovely theme returned, floating like a water-lily on the waves of surely one of the most perfect accompaniments with which a genius was ever inspired. One seemed to see two happy lovers united for ever, wandering through the fields of heaven; one seemed to hear the words, “And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes, and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain.”",18Ll-uu-uu,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/3b962f54bdc7412b74ef8c5a33f2c358,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/8822ac1060b2821a5301d5a88d4c8eae/1452163330077,Indoor Public Accompanied,http://musicbrainz.org/artist/eca4d562-1e5c-409a-89fa-5489d102cdcb#_,Maude V.

[The] Havana troupe was notable for its corps of fine singers, among them being some of the world’s foremost artists. Tedesco, the soprano, was truly a great dramatic singer. After the Boston season was over, she went to Paris, and easily won the first place in all European opera houses. Then there was Vita, the contralto, a splendid singer, second only to Alboni. Then came Perelli, the tenor, who was a fine singer, a thorough musician, and a remarkable pianist This artist after leaving Boston made his home in Philadelphia. There was also Novelli, a magnificent basso, who became well known in Boston, as he visited that city many times subsequently.
The opera had a good effective chorus, and a complete orchestra, with Arditi (afterward so well known) as maestro, or conductor, and first violin,—it being the custom in those days for the leader to beat time with his bow, playing on his violin when he desired to assist or to animate his men. […] I must not omit to say that Arditi was a true virtuoso on the violin.
[…] They had for contrabasso the world-renowned Bottesini, a veritable Paganini on his big instrument. The troupe performed but three times per week. That also was the prevailing custom of the day.
[…]
It was customary for the troupe to give concerts in the theatre on Saturday evenings, on which occasions Arditi and Bottesini played solos.",1847-uu-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greater_Boston,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/46a31b796b8a84ef22a8d7cdfabb7da5/1449567274111,Indoor Accompanied Public,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Thomas+Ryan/1448997315048,Thomas Ryan,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Contralto http://dbpedia.org/resource/Male_vocals http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soprano http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tenor http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bass_(voice_type) http://dbpedia.org/resource/Female_vocals,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

It would be hard to imagine all the opposition I had to overcome in giving that concert. There was the hostility of the public, the ill-will of the Theatre Italien which rented me its famous hall but which sullenly opposed a proper announcement of the concert, the insubordination of the orchestra, the demands of the singers for more pay they imagined that Liszt would pay the expenses and, finally, complete and expected failure. My only object was to lay a foundation for the future, nothing more.

The brilliant stage career of David Bispham virtually had&nbsp;its beginning with his singularly picturesque embodiment of the&nbsp;Duc de Longueville in ""La Basoche."" There was about it an&nbsp;element of fantastic bizarrerie that was singularly attractive, and &nbsp;which at once drew attention to the unique personality of the &nbsp;artist.&nbsp;From that time forward, in whatever branch of his art&nbsp;he has elected to labor, David Bispham has consistently earned &nbsp;distinction and applause; and his success has been equally emphatic on both sides of the Atlantic. His gift of versatility is &nbsp;extraordinary. Alike in serious and comic characters, in Wagnerian music-drama and light French opera, in oratorio and &nbsp;Lieder, in declamation both spoken and sung, he has proved himself a thoroughly intellectual, accomplished, and original artist.

The concert room is not large, but convenient, and good for musical effect. The centre of the room is occupied by ladies, and the outer seats mostly by gentlemen. A narrow gallery, in which are a number of private boxes, runs round the room. The first object of attraction, after entering the room, is a fine large medallion of Mendelssohn, back of the orchestra; there is no other bust or picture in the room. It makes one feel sod when looking at this fine representation of the great modem composer, in the very room where he has been, and still is, so highly appreciated, and where he has so often triumphed gloriously, to think that he was cut off in his youth, and that the musical world, after so short a time of enjoyment, was deprived of the talents and learning of one who promised to do for music, perhaps, more than any man living. At almost every concert, more or less of his music is performed; his memory is cherished, not only here, where he was so well known, but by all the musical world, and his name shall be held in everlasting remembrance.
A crowd of people were waiting round the door, when we arrived; and, although it was an hour before the time for the performance to commence, the room was filled, (save the reserved seats in the gallery,) in a few minutes after the door was opened. One must be on hand at an early hour to get a good seat. In about half an hour the members of the orchestra began to make their appearance, and as all the people in the house were talking loud, so the musicians, as they came in, one after another, began to tune, to try their instruments, and to amuse themselves by running over the scales; so that by the time they were all there, thus employed, the room was filled with sound; the more so because, as the musicians began to exercise themselves upon their instruments, the talking and laughing grew louder and louder, and at a quarter of an hour before the commencement of the music, it was a perfect Babel in the concert room, and as difficult to hear one speak as it is in a railroad car, with all the windows open, in summer. But a few minutes before the hour, the room began to grow quiet, musical expectation began to awaken, and when, as the precise moment arrived, the conductor’s signal was heard, everything was still, and perfect silence took the place of noise and confusion. Another signal, and the whole band, as one man, were heard interpreting and presenting to a most attentive audience, one of the great works of the immortal Beethoven.
It was the Sinfonie No. 8, F major. This is not regarded as one of Beethoven’s greatest triumphs; but, although it is light and playful, it abounds in each of its four movements, with the most fanciful and imaginative melodic figures, contrapuntal points, and instrumental contrasts. Ever lively and ever new, it never tires, but holds one in a kind of musical ecstasy from beginning to end; there seems to be no place where one can relax attention, or cease to be filled with musical delight; so that at the close of each part, a good long breath naturally comes in as a relief; and one becomes conscious of the intensity of the application he has been giving to the discourse.
The very first thing which strikes one, on hearing such an orchestra as this, is the perfect oneness of the violins. They do, indeed, constitute a perfect chorus — ten or more persons are playing the first violin, and as many more the second; but they are all artists, and, therefore, each one loses himself; no one is heard above the others; but all so beautifully blend as to constitute one perfect whole. This is the perfection of a chorus, be it vocal or instrumental; and this effect is produced by the Gewandhaus Orchestra.
Another point, immediately noticed, is the proper proportion of wind and stringed instruments; but perhaps the most striking point, as contrasted with our American orchestras, is the perfection of the wind instruments. It is too often the case in our orchestras that some wind instrument is wanting; thus the oboe or the faggotto is often missing; and again, it is not unfrequently the case that, although there may be some one to hold these or other instruments in the hand, or up to the sight of the audience, a tone is seldom permitted to escape from them; they are seen but not heard, Not so here; every instrument is not only represented to the eye, but is in the hands of a master who makes it speak to the ear. The consequence is, that such combinations fall upon the ear as are not heard with us. The brass instruments too are made to tell their story without any impediment of speech; whereas, with us, they stutter, or falter, or hem, or cough, to the no small disturbance of the equilibrium of one’s temper. We do not know that in this concert every instrument is played in all respects right; we do not know but some notes may have been omitted, or wrong tones produced, but certain are we that we did not discover any such imperfections. There are four things, (technical points,) that we have seldom heard well exhibited elsewhere, which were exceedingly well brought out here, viz.: Piano, Crescendo, Diminuendo and Fortzando. These, with the other technicals of playing were so well observed, that added to the pure tone peculiar to each particular instrument, and connected with a most perfect amalgamation or blending of all the different elements of the orchestra, they seemed to produce, not a mere musical performance to be listened to, but a living being, or moral, spiritual existence, capable of expressing the deepest feeling, and of calling forth the strongest sympathies of humanity.
The Sinfonie being over, and a few moments for rest having been given, old Handel visited us in an Arie from his Opera “Aerio” — “Folle e colui che al tuo favor si fida.” It was sung by Herrn Salvatore Marchesi, who was the only vocalist for the evening. The song was well sung; but we sometimes hear quite as good singing across the Atlantic. Belletti is decidedly his superior. The third piece was a Flute Concerto; it was a tiresome affair. A Flute Concerto is a Flute Concerto, whether in the Gewandhaus, Hanover Square rooms, Tripler Hall or the Melodeon; and although it may not be always played by Herrn W. Haake, (who certainly did his duty well,) it is always the most dry and uninteresting of musical performances.
In part 2d was given, 1st, the beautiful overture Echoes of Ossian, (often played in New York and Boston,) by N. W. Gade. 2d. Arie from Zauberflote, by Mozart, “Qui sdegno non s' accende."" 3d. Mendelssohn’s concerto for the piano forte, in D. Minor. 4th. Arie from Don Giovanni, by Mozart, “Madamina, il catalogo e questo,"" and 5th. The very fine overture to the opera, “Der Wassertrager,” by Cherubini.
Gade’s overture may be regarded as a sacred piece. It speaks of greatness, and calls forth emotions of the sublime. Something like an Old Chorale pervades the whole, which seems to tell of worship, and to call forth humble adoration. With what grandeur this subject was given out, and oft in the course of the piece alluded to by the brass instruments, or exemplified and illustrated by the others, cannot be told. The overture is known with us, but it requires and deserves dose study.
The Piano Forte Concerto, D (not G) Minor, failed for want of a performer; a highly promising young lad of the conservatory attempted it, but he had neither grasp of mind nor of hand enough for Mendelssohn. Herr Marchesi sang both airs well, gaining for himself decided applause.
On the whole, here is a highly-talented and well-regulated orchestra. The conductor for the evening was Julius Rietz, well known to the musical world.
I will mention one or two things about the audience:
1st. Gentlemen took off their hats before passing the door of the hall, all of them, without a single exception; and this, although they were there an hour before the performance commenced. There was not a single man standing under the galleries or near the doors, uncovered. The ungentlemanly act of standing or sitting in a concert room with hats on, could not be seen in the Gewandhaus.
2d. Ladies were all in full dress.
3d. There was silence during the performance of music. The moment the music ceased, then indeed there was a perfect buzzing of voices, and very loud talking all over the room; but at the signal for the commencement of the music, all was still; and we were not prevented from hearing the music by those whisperings, so annoying in some places.
On the whole, this was a very fine concert; the orchestra playing was as near to perfection, I doubt not, as can often be found; and that constitutes the great attraction of the Gewandhaus. Every man seems to be able to play on his own instrument well; every man seems to give undivided attention to the music, and to endeavor to observe carefully, not only the time, as given by the conductor, but all those little gesticulations by which expression is indicated.

&nbsp;Teresa [Carrefio ]* made her first appearance in Boston, January 4, 1863. She remained here about one month, and was a great attraction at the grand orchestral concerts which were given at that period under the direction of Carl Zerrahn or P. S. Gilmore. She created a furore of enthusiasm every time she played. I doubt if any child pianist of the same age has ever exceeded her in ability. Imagine a child of nine years playing Thalberg’s Moses, Gottschalk’s Jerusalem, and similar pieces, full of technical difficulties.

But the chief attraction of the ante-Easter season was reserved for the ""Attila "" of Verdi, the opera in which I had first heard and been charmed with the rich voice and dramatic qualities of Sophie Cruvelli, at Padua. This was, in fact, the opera in which she first appeared upon any stage. None, perhaps, of Verdi's works had kindled more enthusiasm in Italy, or crowned the fortunate composer with more abundant laurels than his ""Attila."" Its fame was great in the native land of the composer. In catering for novelty, therefore, the Director of Her Majesty's Theatre must be held to have done well in producing a work of so great repute, and in placing before his subscribers the leading opera of the day upon the Italian stage. To prove with what good will this was done, the opera had been ""mounted"" with great scenic splendour, and with every ""appliance"" likely to produce effect. ""Attila "" was produced on Tuesday, the 14th of March. Cruvelli sang ""con fuoco."" Her fine fresh ringing voice ""told."" Beletti displayed unusual histrionic talent, besides all that steadiness and excellence of ""school,"" which helped to earn him his reputation in this country. Gardoni was in the ""cast”' whilst Cuzzani accepted a second tenor part. On every side were zeal, talent, and good-will employed successfully to execute a work which many cities of Italy had pronounced to be Verdi's masterpiece. But although Verdi had already commenced to make his way to English favour — and this by means of that vigour and dramatic fire which unquestionably belonged to him — the public displayed an unwonted unanimity of sulkiness upon the production of ""Attila."" They would have ""none of it."" Consequently ""Attila"" proved a failure. Music and libretto displeased alike.",http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/day/1848-03-14,,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/fd1f479d9de6355c98df1e1dfcc1750f/1438763779873,Accompanied Public Indoor,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Benjamin+Lumley/1438607277398,Benjamin Lumley,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

In the evening to the Opera. Venice is the land of late hours: the scene in St. Mark's Place at midnight is more gay and animated than at any hour of the day; and it is after the opera that evening parties and conversazioni commence. The Gondoliers no longer sing the verses of Tasso; but you are frequently regaled with beautiful music from parties of dilettanti musicians. I ought to record, as an instance of the obliging civility of the Italians, that I met a serenading party in a Gondola to-night, singing very beautifully to their guitars the songs of a favourite opera. Supposing they were professional people, and under the idea that I was to make them a recompense, I detained them half an hour; and it was not till they explained their refusal of any remuneration, that I found it was a nobleman's family returning from an excursion to Padua.",1818-05-28TLl:ll:ll,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Venice,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/6bdcb760f2238253ed504e1d86fe6f8c/1518782699995,Indoor Public Outdoor,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Henry+Matthews/1518777337226,Henry Matthews,Performance,,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

In Christmas time, all quarters of Naples resound with Pastorali or Siciliane, a kind of simple rural music, executed by Abruzzese or Calabrian shepherds, upon a species of bag pipes, called in Abruzzo, Zampogna, and Ciaramelli in Calabria. The tunes vary according to the provinces: in the south, they have three different&nbsp;airs; the northern shepherds know only two, to which they add what variations the boldness of their own genius inspires. The boys learn of their fathers to play upon this instrument as the means of subsistence. At other seasons, it is rare to hear any agreeable sounds in the streets of Naples, though it is the nursery of musical professors: a school, where the greatest masters have imbibed their principles, and acquired that knowledge of composition, which has enchanted the ears of all Europe. There is no such thing as a national music, unless we give that name to a monotonous drawling seguidilla, that serves the nurses as a lullaby to put their children to rest, and&nbsp;seems borrowed from the Spaniards, who, I believe, learnt it of the Moors. I never resided in any Italian town where there was a less musical turn in the populace: few songs, guittars, vielles, or organs, enliven the evenings, as in the northern states of Italy, unless they be sent for to entertain the parties that in summer sup on the shore of Posilipo. 
They do not even dance to music, but perform the Tarantella to the beating of a kind of tambourine, which was in use among their ancestors, as appears by the pictures of Herculaneum.

The conductor was Robert Schumann himself; the pianist was his wife. The orchestra was large, and the best that Leipzig could furnish. Robert Schumann has great celebrity, and especially in those cities where he has resided and has brought out his music under his own immediate direction. No one since Mendelssohn’s death stands so high in the estimation of the German musicians. There are places where he is not known, because his music is not understood; but even in these, and throughout Germany, he is regarded as standing at the very head of his profession, and no one commands aa. he does the universal attention of scientific men. Some go so far as to regard him as the greatest symphonist that has ever lived; but time can only determine this.
The concert had been advertised for some time, and the expectations of the lovers of music were fully awake. Not only were the musicians and lovers of music of Leipzig present, but literary and scientific men of the various professions, and the beauty, and wealth, and fashion of the city came to do homage to talent of so high an order, and to learning so extensive. Like the people at Lystra, so here, they lifted up their voices, saying, not in the speech of Lycaonia, but in that of Saxony ""The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men.”&nbsp;
[...]
But it was not only from this city that the audience was gathered on this occasion; it had been noised abroad that this concert was to be given, and musical men of high standing, Kapellmeisters and Concertmeisters, from the region round about, came up to Leipzig. Berlin, Dresden, Weimar, and other places were represented. At the head of this foreign company, and indeed at the head of the whole company, was Lis[zt];— the very Lis[zt] himself came from Weimar to listen, and to pay honor to greatness. But Robert Schumann is not alone, he has a “help meet” indeed. Clara Wieck was perhaps the most distinguished female pianist who has ever lived; and, unlike many ladies, she did not give up her instrument when she became Clara Schumann, but rather devoted herself with greater assiduousness under her new instructor, than she had previously done under the teachings of her father, to the profession which had been the choice of both her husband and herself. No wonder that the people should assemble on the occasion of a visit from this far-famed couple. But they came not to hear any one sing or play on an instrument, for although the wife is indeed a most accomplished pianist, yet the husband neither plays nor sings; but they rather came to hear the new music that the master had produced. They looked for some new musical revelation, for new chords (if possible), or new progressions; at least some new method of treatment, or harmonic development was expected. It was not to be the same tune over again. They went away satisfied; for, not only was the musical performance pronounced to be one of the very best, but the music, or the principal piece of attraction, was regarded as worthy of its author.
The first piece was the “Overture zu L. Byron's Manfred&nbsp;von R. Schumann,"" This is an overture in the true learned German style, and as unlike the overtures of the modem Italian and French schools as can be imagined; of course, it cannot be popular, that is, it cannot take with the people generally; on this occasion, however, it was fully appreciated and listened to, by one of the most intelligent musical audiences that could be brought together in Germany, with unmingled delight. The second piece was “Concert No. 2, F moll, fur Piano Forte mit Begleitung des or Chester, von F. Chopin,” performed by Clara Schumann. This is said to be in Chopin’s peculiar style, and one of his most difficult productions. Mad. Schumann played it with apparent ease, and with a delicacy of touch and distinctness of articulation not to be excelled. She has not so great a power as some; in this respect she resembles Chopin himself, but in everything else requisite to the perfection of piano forte playing she is fully accomplished. The third piece was a song by Herr Behr, necessary for variety’s sake; after which Mad. Schumann played most charmingly two pieces- “Andantino von W. Sterndale Bennett"" and ""Lied ohne Worte (F major), von F. Mendelssohn Bartholdy.”
The second part of the concert (and here was the attraction) consisted of “Die Pilgerfahrt der Rose” (the pilgrimage of the rose), a new composition for voices (solo and chorus) and orchestra by Robert Schumann. This has been performed here a week or two before, and was noticed in a previous communication. Anything like an analytical notice of it from one who has heard it but once or twice would hardly be expected, and in the present case it would be quite absurd. It will be known in a few years. The orchestra never played better; the idea of playing under Schumann inspired every man with new life and energy, and the improvement in the performance of the music under the direction of the composer (there having been a previous rehearsal also under his teaching), was said to be very apparent. We can hardly imagine a musical occasion that would be more interesting or exciting especially to the truly enlightened musician than this. For the few details here given we are indebted to others, for we did not attend this concert; we neither saw the sight nor heard the sound thereof. Why? It was given on Sunday Morning, March 14th, at 11 o'clock.",http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/day/1852-03-14,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/0a19459865ed69275723d6efb76048c9,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/ad2782bcbd614558bf2ecfc5661c026c/1448284963643,Accompanied Indoor Public,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Franz+Liszt/1424794451085 http://musicbrainz.org/artist/f422b99a-b48c-4bee-bc0c-f2e8cad82b6c#_,Franz Liszt Dr. Lowell Mason Lowell Mason,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Overture

Whilst Madame Sontag — whose return to London, as well as that of the other principal artists, was a matter of public notoriety — was yet singing in Paris, I had recourse to Madame Parodi, one of the objects of interest in the previous season. She was to appear as the chief ""star"" of the pre-Easter period, and considerable excitement was awakened in musical circles by the announcement that Pasta's favourite pupil would sustain the character of Medea, one of the parts of that great singer that were most strongly stamped upon the memory of a former generation of opera-goers. So, with the ""Medea"" of Mayer, and Mademoiselle Parodi as the enchantress, the theatre once more opened its doors. That I had been judicious in producing this opera, as a lure to curiosity, was attested by the result. But it never could have been expected to occupy a permanent position on the boards of Her Majesty's Theatre. The music of Mayer was of the ante-Rossinian school, and was consequently entitled to the respect of the old opera- goers, who in their early days had looked upon Rossini as a mere tune-maker. But it was not one of the best specimens of the early period of the present century, and it had owed its reputation to the correctness of its cold classicality, and, on the Anglo-Italian stage, to the powerful acting of Pasta. To modern ears it seemed tedious and almost commonplace — at all events, deficient in the dramatic warmth of later composers. The ""mantle"" of Pasta however, even to the literal acceptation of the word, had descended to her pupil; Parodi's performance created a lively interest, stamped, as it was, with the traditions of the great vocal Siddons of the Italian stage. It was powerful, impressive, and, of its kind, brilliant. The ""cast"" included Beletti and Calzolari — both sure, steady, and satisfactory singers of another school; Madame Giuliani; and, lastly, a new tenor, Micheli, who made his first appearance as Giasone, but failed utterly to obtain a favourable verdict from the critical audience of ""Her Majesty's.""",http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/day/1850-03-12,,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/0f36a9a96e8045e12fa2f4add502886f/1438779727748,Indoor Public Accompanied,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Benjamin+Lumley/1438607277398,Benjamin Lumley,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

I make these few remarks by way of preface to the notice of the ""Visitors' Night,"" given by the Leicester Amateur Madrigal Society last spring, when a company of twenty or thirty amateurs, assisted by a choir of treble boys, gave an evening's entertainment at the New Hall, to a large company. The performance was conducted by Mr. May, who, though a young amateur, has all the tact and precision of an experienced professed musician, and a knowledge of the subject rarely equalled...The meeting drew together all the first families of this town and neighbourhood. When gentlemen set about any public affair we may be assured it will be handsomely done. The arrangements of the room were much improved, and showed much taste...At eight o'clock, about thirty gentlemen and twelve boys glided in upon an elevated stage, and sat down to half-a-dozen tables, with their books and wax- lights, as in the olden time of Henry the Eighth and Elizabeth...The charm of the boys voices delighted me indeed : they were lusciously sweet. The ear had not been tortured by a dozen self-sufficient fiddlers tuning their instruments before they made a start. The effect was quite novel and pleasing.

It was a very strange coincidence that the season which witnessed Liszt's final adieu to England should have likewise been the occasion of Anton Rubinstein's last visit. The one left in April; the other came in May. Within a period of six weeks we heard and saw, for the last time, the two greatest pianists that the world had then known. The leonine Russian gave at St. James's Hall that wonderful series of “Historical Recitals” which has since become historical in every sense— that marvelously comprehensive cycle wherein he illustrated the progress and development of pianoforte music from its earliest epoch down to the penultimate decade of the nineteenth century. It was, alike mentally and physically, an extraordinary tour de force. No one save Rubinstein would have attempted the Herculean feat involved in the execution of such programmes. What must the task have been for the executant, if the bare labor of listening was an exhausting process! But Rubinstein was a giant, and the considerations that applied to ordinary pianists did not arise in his case. These recitals yielded the largest sum ever taken at St. James's Hall for a series of seven concerts, the gross receipts amounting to £6000 ($30,000). An extra recital was given, and out of the proceeds Rubinstein divided £300 ($1500) among various charitable institutions.",1886-05-uu,,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/3a9f737d0aea46ca3b29cea0bd203eae/1438263868352,Accompanied Public Indoor,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Hermann+Klein/1438157240872,Hermann Klein,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Piano,

Our concert room here is the Variety Theatre, a fair-sized barn, with doors on hinges up near the roof, opening for light and air. The sides are of weather-boards only, the roof shingled within hardwood, no lining; stars shine through; and as people commonly carry umbrellas, they are prepared to use them in case of a sudden shower. The night of the first concert, we had in the shilling part—rear end of the bam—about two hundred people, mostly miners. These gentlemen were prepared to enjoy the concert in their own way, nearly every one having a good honest clay pipe. The little wax matches which light with a snapping noise were going all the time,—you could plainly see the spark on the back ground of good thick smoke. As we had a large front part of house at four and three shillings, I made up my mind to try the effect of a coaxing appeal to the gentlemen in the rear to abstain from smoking. I spoke of the heat, close air, the general enjoyment which all would realize if they would abstain from smoking while the performances went on. It had the desired effect: they put up their pipes, were very quiet, attentive, and enthusiastic; but when approaching the end of part first, we could hear the little explosive matches on all sides going like fireworks, and at the last note up rose nearly every man, with a good head of pipe on, and marched out the side door, to take the air, and “ see a friend.”",188u-uu-uu,"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Maryborough,_Queensland",http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/fc02d15d2331ec0f91ce75527a66343f/1449478648715,Public Accompanied,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Thomas+Ryan/1448997315048,Thomas Ryan,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Female_vocals http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clarinet http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soprano http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flute http://dbpedia.org/resource/Violin http://dbpedia.org/resource/Viola,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_music

Enough to say that the troupe finally collected by Augustus Harris was the strongest heard in London for several years. The opening representation of “Aida"" on June 13, with brand-new costumes and fresh scenery expressly imported from Italy, fairly took critics and opera-goers by surprise. The triumph of Jean de Eeszke was instantaneous and complete.

While I was yet quite a child, my father happened to have an old lumbering harpsichord thrown on his hands, as part payment of a debt from some bankrupt customer; and when I was a little older, my mother, anxious to try my faculties in all possible ways, employed a youth who was in the service of a tuner in our neighbourhood, to teach me to play. My instructor, however, being young himself, was a good deal more given to romping and jumping than to music, and our time together was chiefly passed in vaulting over the tables and chairs of the drawing-room. The progress I made, therefore, was not such as to induce my mother to continue me in this instruction; and I left off, after acquiring little more than the power of playing two or three tunes with the right hand only. It was soon, however, discovered that I had an agreeable voice and taste for singing; and in the sort of gay life we led (for my mother was always fond of society), this talent of mine was frequently called into play to enliven our tea-parties and suppers. In the summer theatricals too, which I have already recorded, my singing of the songs of Patrick, in the Poor Soldier, —particularly of the duet with Norah, into which I threw a feeling far beyond my years,— was received with but too encouraging applause.",http://data.open.ac.uk/time/interval/178u-uu-uu/to/17uu-Ee-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dublin,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/ab97e9f9a67391b73acfc0d9bc981269/1558349058505,Domestic Indoor Accompanied,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Mrs+Anastasia+Moore/1558351429206 http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Guests+of+Anastasia+Moore/1558351443455,Anastasia Jane Moore Guests of Anastasia Moore,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice http://dbpedia.org/resource/Male_vocals,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Song

We had also visits from ballet companies, at that time very much in vogue. It would doubtless be a strange entertainment for the present age. Imagine people being now asked to spend two or three hours witnessing a play in “ dumb show ” ; though good pantomimic action, artistic dancing, fine scenery, and the best of instrumental music were given.

After this I heard nothing until he came to London in the following June.

The next day we sailed for Melbourne, the Mecca of our pilgrimage, five hundred miles distant. We spent a month delightfully in that city, which we found to be a musical one, if several musical societies and many concerts are good proof of that statement.
We made our debut in a concert given by the Apollo Club, a society built on the lines of that of Boston. It was for us a grand send-off.

We arrived in San Francisco from Australia in the summer of '82, we received a cable message from Mr. Henry E. Abbey, then in London, offering us an engagement to travel the coming season with Madame Christine Nilsson. It was joyfully accepted, and the season was one of the pleasantest we ever passed. We performed on the average three or four times each week, visiting only large cities East and West, and New Orleans and California. The company comprised : Madame Nilsson, soprano; Miss Hope Glen, alto (an American singer who has lived most of her time in London); Mr. Theodore Biorksten, tenor; Signor Del Puente, the well- known baritone; Mr. Charles Pratt, accompanist ; and the Mendelssohn Quintette Club.
Madame Nilsson was in the prime of her vocal powers, and her renditions of the Ah Perfido, Angels ever Bright and Fair, and Connate tu le pays, were examples of great singing. Her chevalde battaille, however, was the “Jewel Song ” from Faust, by Gounod. She used to “ go through all the motions,” just the same as she would in opera. Her ballad singing was a revelation of the fine, tender heart she possessed. It was a rare occasion when she was not forced by popular desire to sing the Suwanee River. She doubtless will be remembered by the great mass of music-lovers as the lady who sang so touchingly about the “old folks at home.",188u-Ee-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/North_America,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/748f04dbe3cb6672eeb93bf663494dbb/1450283858209,Indoor Public Accompanied,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Thomas+Ryan/1448997315048,Thomas Ryan,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soprano http://dbpedia.org/resource/Female_vocals,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Song

WAGNER passed two terrible years, 1840-42, in Paris. MEYERBEER had given him introductions, and introduced him later to M. JOLY, a stage-director at Paris, whom he must have known to be on the point of bankruptcy, and who suspended the rehearsal of the Novice of Palermo at the last moment. But this was but the end of a series of checks. He wrote an overture to Faust. His good friend and faithful ally, SCHLESINGER, editor of the Gazette Musicale, got it rehearsed at the Conservatoire. It sounded quite too strange and bizarre to those ears polite, and was instantly snuffed out.",184u-uu-uu,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/4d81c253b72fb657b2d4826260be2fd8,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/21ede3aab5d881db257ff947d3ef1747/1437986122468,Public Accompanied Indoor,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Concert+audience/1437737637011,Concert audience,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Overture

Three weeks later I met impresario and conductor together at Bayreuth on the day that they &nbsp;were to take their departure. Both were full&nbsp;of the wonders they had seen and heard. The &nbsp;works given that year were “Parsifal”, “Tristan”, and “Die Meistersinger” — the Nuremberg opera &nbsp;for the first time at Bayreuth. I asked Harris &nbsp;which of the three he had decided to do at Covent &nbsp;Garden next season. &nbsp;
“Parsifal”, was his unblushing reply; “that is, &nbsp;if Frau Cosima will oblige me with the necessary &nbsp;permission. But I am afraid she won't. Seriously, though, I should like to do the “Meistersinger”, even if I have to give it in Italian and &nbsp;get the text specially translated. If only Jean &nbsp;de Reszke would sing Walther!

It was for many years the largest in the world, and is famed for its size the world over. We thought it as good as it is great, and listened to its tones with delight. It is indeed very powerful, but its&nbsp;full power is seldom heard, and never in public worship. There are now several organs as large, or larger; for example, the organ in the Town Hall, at Birmingham; but although the Haarlem organ is now equaled in size, and although various improvements (especially within a few years past) have been made both in action and in pipes, yet there is not perhaps anywhere to be found, a more powerful chorus than that of this famous instrument. Dr. Burney took particular pains to examine and describe it, many years ago; and, in his ""Musical Tour in Holland,"" he gives the details which have been often copied and published. The present organist has fine execution, and appears to understand well his instrument; but, it is a pity that, for the sake of pleasing his company, and confirming his hearers in a bad taste, he should employ its noble powers in battle-piece and thunder-storm representations; or, at least, that these should be made the principal feature of his exhibitions.",1853-Ee-uu,"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Grote_Kerk,_Haarlem",http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/ab49746a0869c81139406964658548d5/1462037895909,Accompanied Public Indoor,http://musicbrainz.org/artist/f422b99a-b48c-4bee-bc0c-f2e8cad82b6c#_,Dr. Lowell Mason Lowell Mason,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pipe_organ,

They consist of vocal and instrumental music, but without orchestra. They employ some five or six solo performers, and a choir of about forty-five choristers. Glees and madrigals are sung by the choir, and songs, duets, &amp;c., by the solo voices, with piano forte pieces, violin pieces, or other instruments as it may be convenient to obtain for the different concerts. I attended the second of the series on Thursday last. The large Exeter Hall was full of people, who seemed to be much delighted with the music; indeed I thought that there was more warmth of approval exhibited there than we usually see at the best concerts with us. The solo performers were Miss Pyne, Miss Louisa Pyne, Miss Binckes, Mr. Swift, (a new tenor,) Herr Jonghmans, Mr. Cotton, and Mr. Whitworth. Miss Goddard played serenade (Don Pasquale), by Thalberg, and also an andante and rondo capricioso by Mendelssohn, on the piano forte, and Mr. Richardson played an air with variations on the flute. Miss Binckes has a very fine voice, and sung to the great acceptance of the audience, and Miss Louisa Pyne sung quite a difficult aria by Rode, which called forth a most enthusiastic encore. The pieces for full choir were performed without accompaniment, not even the piano forte being played; and although I have heard a better chorus at home, yet this was truly good. The concert was conducted by Mr. T. H. Severn. The programme contained the music to the National Anthem, printed in full in four parts, and the whole audience joined in this the closing chorus:
&nbsp;
“God save our gracious Queen,
Long may Victoria reign;
God save the Queen!
Send her victorious,
Happy and glorious,
Long to reign over us,
God save the Queen!

""O Lord our God arise,
Scatter her enemies,
And make them fall.
Confound their politics,
Frustrate their knavish tricks,
On Thee our hopes we fix,
God save us all.

The first time I remember really appreciating music was on one winter afternoon. I was alone in the sitting-room, trying to do my lessons, perched up on my favourite window-seat. In reality I was listening to the trio my governess was playing in the next room with a violinist and ’cello player, friends of hers, who used sometimes to come over from Mannheim to make music with her. I don’t know what they were playing,—it was probably something classical,—but it began to affect me very strangely. I felt horribly sad, but I wasn’t crying. I was simply longing for something, but I didn’t know what. After a while they left off playing, and Mel came into the sitting-room to see what I was doing. Evidently I didn’t look quite normal, for she asked me what was the matter. I said in a choking voice, “ I think I have a sore throat.” I hadn’t a sore throat, but it was the first time I had ever had a lump in my throat, and I didn’t know what it meant then.

I had no lessons, but was sent to practise by myself for an hour every afternoon on a horrid little upright piano in the dreary dining-room.
&nbsp;
Of course I did nothing of the sort; in the first place, I had nothing to practise, for I certainly had no intention of learning any of the really dreadful drawing-room pieces with which the piano was covered. Occasionally I played through one of them, for I read music quite easily. How I jibbed at the “Prière d’une Vierge”! The “Gems of Scotland,” set in arpeggios and triplets, were sham jewels for which I had unmitigated contempt, and one or two pieces by Brinsley Richards made my flesh creep. I had such frightful attacks of low spirits in that dreary back room that I never think of it without horror. After some months I began to connect music itself with those four walls and those hideous tenth-rate compositions which lay in bilious green and yellow covers on the top of the piano, and it seemed to me that my own love of music was being slowly poisoned to death. So much for atmosphere! When I left Miss Reach’s at the end of the year, I would not have cared if I had never set eyes on a piano again. I almost hated the sight of one.

Sontag, by marriage the Countess Rossi. The weather was unfavorable, being rainy, and the streets were muddy. I took my place at the door of the Gewandhaus at half-past four, where the people were then gathering. By five, when the outer door was opened, a multitude had assembled, and immediately rushed into the house, filling the long stairway and entry. Here was another interval of waiting, until half-past five, when the door of the hall was opened, and the room was immediately filled. We had now to wait another hour, or until half-past six; when the performance commenced with a Symphonie, by Joseph Hadyn in C, very light, playful, and pleasing, but lacking the depth of a Beethoven or a Mendelssohn. It is so easy a composition, that it seemed to be quite children’s play for the orchestra, who yet rendered it in the most perfect manner possible. This was followed by an Arie from “Rinaldo” by Handel; a most charming song indeed, and as charmingly sung by Mad. Sontag. Of Mad. Sontag’s singing, I dare not speak now. I will only say that no one can have a more perfect execution; but to say in what her excellence consists, as a singer, or what are the peculiarities of her style, must not now be attempted.
The third piece was “Romanze for the Violin,” by Beethoven; performed by Herr Concertmeister, Ferdinand David. This is the David whose compositions for the violin are so well known, and whose reputation as a player is so extensive. Mad. Sontag then sang ""Bel raggio lusinghier,"" from Rossini’s Semiramide, a song requiring the greatest powers of vocalization; this was perfectly given by the inimitable artist.
The second part consisted of the Overture and a long scene from Gluck’s famous “Iphigenie in Tauride;"" the principal vocal part being that of Iphigenie by Mad. Sontag. Gluck has not been heard with us, but he ranks in the very first class of composers here. The overture is a magnificent concert piece, and it was performed by this fine orchestra with wonderful precision and effect.

Not that Augustus Harris left a stone unturned to direct to a successful issue the policy and the task bequeathed him by Carl Rosa. &nbsp;He signalized the very first year after his old partner's death by arranging for the company to renew its Easter visit to Drury Lane. Rosa had &nbsp;commissioned Frederic Cowen after his return &nbsp;from Australia to write an opera expressly for &nbsp;him. The libretto was supplied by Mr. Joseph &nbsp;Bennett, who, knowing the composer's fondness &nbsp;for Scandinavian color, founded his plot upon an &nbsp;&nbsp;episode in the ancient Icelandic tale of “Viglund&nbsp;the Fair."" Cowen's “Thorgrim"" was duly produced at Drury Lane on April 22,— some thirteen &nbsp;and a half years after Carl Rosa had brought out &nbsp;his “Pauline"" at the Lyceum,— with Zelie de Lussan, Barton McGuckin, and Frank Celli in the&nbsp;principal parts. The Prince of Wales, to whom &nbsp;the work was dedicated, attended the first performance with the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh;&nbsp;and the composer conducted an admirable rendering of his opera.

It was an old ballad, which I had heard once before : —
'Say, have you in the village seen A lonely youth, of pensive mien? If such a one hath passed by, With melancholy in his eye, Where is he gone ? Ah, tell me where! Tis Allan Brook, of Windermere.' 
It was sung by Miss Jane. Her pensive look, and the soft accents of her voice, enchanted me. The spell, however, was suddenly broken by the wine- drinkers bursting into the room. They had listened to the song, and begged to hear it again. The Captain, however, with good taste, called upon his daughter to sing him his favourite : —
 ""In the world's crooked path where I've been, There to share of life's gloom my poor part, The bright sunshine that softened the scene Was a smile from the girl of my heart."" 
This was loudly applauded.I had crept into a corner during this interval, when my fair one asked me to sing.

Early in December, 1878, Wagner made up his mind that his wife should be
serenaded on her birthday at Christmas with the strains of the “Vorspiel""
to “Parsifal,"" of which work he had then completed the first act. The only
question was how to obtain an orchestra. After some reflection, Wagner
determined to procure the services of the celebrated Meiningen performers, but
of course without their conductor, then no other than Dr. Hans von Biilow, Frau
Cosima Wagner’s first husband. The project was kept a profound secret, and
young Anton Seidl was forthwith despatched to Meiningen to arrange matters with
the band. He arrived there early in the morning, and went direct to the hotel
at which von Bulow was staying. The worthy doctor was practising, and, being
unacquainted with Seidl, sent out word that he could not see him until eleven
o'clock. Accordingly, at that hour he presented himself at the great pianist's
apartment and was duly ushered into his presence. At the first mention of
Wagner's name von Bulow drew himself up and inquired in an icy tone what it was
that Herr Wagner wanted. Seidl explained the object of his mission.The “ambassador"" quickly found the leader
of the band, and, the Duke of Meiningen's permission being readily granted, it
was arranged that the men should be at Bayreuth by a certain evening. They
assembled in good time at the Sonne Hotel, where Wagner met them and conducted
a rehearsal of the “Vorspiel” Early next morning, while Frau Cosima was still
asleep, the heavier instruments were conveyed to Wahnfried, and the players
quietly stationed themselves at their desks in the vestibule and upon the
staircase. When all was ready, Wagner gave the signal, and his much-honored
wife awoke from her slumbers to hear for the first time the mystic phrases of
the prelude to “Parsifal”.",http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/day/1878-12-24,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/699f5ab3038fc8dab8293eccdfb7dcec,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/df1370f4030a5a532c9445c68b226091/1438591177681,Accompanied Indoor Domestic,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Cosima+Wagner/1437990331484,Cosima Wagner,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prelude_(music)

That same summer I saw a great deal of Herr Raimond von Zur Mühlen. I don’t believe a finer Lieder singer ever lived. People’s opinion used to differ about his voice, but real musicians were unanimous about his splendid interpretation of German music. Rubinstein once put off a performance of one of his works because Von Zur Mühlen was not able to sing in it. To hear him interpret Schumann and Brahms was a perfect revelation. To my intense delight he took up a great number of my German songs, and I can only say that I adored the way he sang them. He sang with splendid rhythm, with such pathos, such deep feeling, and often with such real ecstasy, that it was quite impossible for any musician not to feel enthusiastic over him.

It was the first time I ever saw the Metropolitan Opera House, and I was much struck with its handsome proportions. Then again, under Anton Seidl 's magic wand, the performance touched at all points a very high level of excellence. Finally, I derived immense pleasure from the novel sensation of hearing Jean and Edouard de Reszke as exponents of Wagner's own text. Their conscientious enunciation of each syllable, their accurate diction, and their admirable accent seemed to impart an added dignity alike to the music and to their impersonations. Even the more cultivated listener might easily have imagined them to be native German singers. Mme. Nordica, too, handled the German words with remarkable facility and confidence.

The concert room is not large, but convenient, and good for musical effect. The centre of the room is occupied by ladies, and the outer seats mostly by gentlemen. A narrow gallery, in which are a number of private boxes, runs round the room. The first object of attraction, after entering the room, is a fine large medallion of Mendelssohn, back of the orchestra; there is no other bust or picture in the room. It makes one feel sod when looking at this fine representation of the great modem composer, in the very room where he has been, and still is, so highly appreciated, and where he has so often triumphed gloriously, to think that he was cut off in his youth, and that the musical world, after so short a time of enjoyment, was deprived of the talents and learning of one who promised to do for music, perhaps, more than any man living. At almost every concert, more or less of his music is performed; his memory is cherished, not only here, where he was so well known, but by all the musical world, and his name shall be held in everlasting remembrance.
A crowd of people were waiting round the door, when we arrived; and, although it was an hour before the time for the performance to commence, the room was filled, (save the reserved seats in the gallery,) in a few minutes after the door was opened. One must be on hand at an early hour to get a good seat. In about half an hour the members of the orchestra began to make their appearance, and as all the people in the house were talking loud, so the musicians, as they came in, one after another, began to tune, to try their instruments, and to amuse themselves by running over the scales; so that by the time they were all there, thus employed, the room was filled with sound; the more so because, as the musicians began to exercise themselves upon their instruments, the talking and laughing grew louder and louder, and at a quarter of an hour before the commencement of the music, it was a perfect Babel in the concert room, and as difficult to hear one speak as it is in a railroad car, with all the windows open, in summer. But a few minutes before the hour, the room began to grow quiet, musical expectation began to awaken, and when, as the precise moment arrived, the conductor’s signal was heard, everything was still, and perfect silence took the place of noise and confusion. Another signal, and the whole band, as one man, were heard interpreting and presenting to a most attentive audience, one of the great works of the immortal Beethoven.
It was the Sinfonie No. 8, F major. This is not regarded as one of Beethoven’s greatest triumphs; but, although it is light and playful, it abounds in each of its four movements, with the most fanciful and imaginative melodic figures, contrapuntal points, and instrumental contrasts. Ever lively and ever new, it never tires, but holds one in a kind of musical ecstasy from beginning to end; there seems to be no place where one can relax attention, or cease to be filled with musical delight; so that at the close of each part, a good long breath naturally comes in as a relief; and one becomes conscious of the intensity of the application he has been giving to the discourse.
The very first thing which strikes one, on hearing such an orchestra as this, is the perfect oneness of the violins. They do, indeed, constitute a perfect chorus — ten or more persons are playing the first violin, and as many more the second; but they are all artists, and, therefore, each one loses himself; no one is heard above the others; but all so beautifully blend as to constitute one perfect whole. This is the perfection of a chorus, be it vocal or instrumental; and this effect is produced by the Gewandhaus Orchestra.
Another point, immediately noticed, is the proper proportion of wind and stringed instruments; but perhaps the most striking point, as contrasted with our American orchestras, is the perfection of the wind instruments. It is too often the case in our orchestras that some wind instrument is wanting; thus the oboe or the faggotto is often missing; and again, it is not unfrequently the case that, although there may be some one to hold these or other instruments in the hand, or up to the sight of the audience, a tone is seldom permitted to escape from them; they are seen but not heard, Not so here; every instrument is not only represented to the eye, but is in the hands of a master who makes it speak to the ear. The consequence is, that such combinations fall upon the ear as are not heard with us. The brass instruments too are made to tell their story without any impediment of speech; whereas, with us, they stutter, or falter, or hem, or cough, to the no small disturbance of the equilibrium of one’s temper. We do not know that in this concert every instrument is played in all respects right; we do not know but some notes may have been omitted, or wrong tones produced, but certain are we that we did not discover any such imperfections. There are four things, (technical points,) that we have seldom heard well exhibited elsewhere, which were exceedingly well brought out here, viz.: Piano, Crescendo, Diminuendo and Fortzando. These, with the other technicals of playing were so well observed, that added to the pure tone peculiar to each particular instrument, and connected with a most perfect amalgamation or blending of all the different elements of the orchestra, they seemed to produce, not a mere musical performance to be listened to, but a living being, or moral, spiritual existence, capable of expressing the deepest feeling, and of calling forth the strongest sympathies of humanity.
The Sinfonie being over, and a few moments for rest having been given, old Handel visited us in an Arie from his Opera “Aerio” — “Folle e colui che al tuo favor si fida.” It was sung by Herrn Salvatore Marchesi, who was the only vocalist for the evening. The song was well sung; but we sometimes hear quite as good singing across the Atlantic. Belletti is decidedly his superior. The third piece was a Flute Concerto; it was a tiresome affair. A Flute Concerto is a Flute Concerto, whether in the Gewandhaus, Hanover Square rooms, Tripler Hall or the Melodeon; and although it may not be always played by Herrn W. Haake, (who certainly did his duty well,) it is always the most dry and uninteresting of musical performances.
In part 2d was given, 1st, the beautiful overture Echoes of Ossian, (often played in New York and Boston,) by N. W. Gade. 2d. Arie from Zauberflote, by Mozart, “Qui sdegno non s' accende."" 3d. Mendelssohn’s concerto for the piano forte, in D. Minor. 4th. Arie from Don Giovanni, by Mozart, “Madamina, il catalogo e questo,"" and 5th. The very fine overture to the opera, “Der Wassertrager,” by Cherubini.
Gade’s overture may be regarded as a sacred piece. It speaks of greatness, and calls forth emotions of the sublime. Something like an Old Chorale pervades the whole, which seems to tell of worship, and to call forth humble adoration. With what grandeur this subject was given out, and oft in the course of the piece alluded to by the brass instruments, or exemplified and illustrated by the others, cannot be told. The overture is known with us, but it requires and deserves dose study.
The Piano Forte Concerto, D (not G) Minor, failed for want of a performer; a highly promising young lad of the conservatory attempted it, but he had neither grasp of mind nor of hand enough for Mendelssohn. Herr Marchesi sang both airs well, gaining for himself decided applause.
On the whole, here is a highly-talented and well-regulated orchestra. The conductor for the evening was Julius Rietz, well known to the musical world.
I will mention one or two things about the audience:
1st. Gentlemen took off their hats before passing the door of the hall, all of them, without a single exception; and this, although they were there an hour before the performance commenced. There was not a single man standing under the galleries or near the doors, uncovered. The ungentlemanly act of standing or sitting in a concert room with hats on, could not be seen in the Gewandhaus.
2d. Ladies were all in full dress.
3d. There was silence during the performance of music. The moment the music ceased, then indeed there was a perfect buzzing of voices, and very loud talking all over the room; but at the signal for the commencement of the music, all was still; and we were not prevented from hearing the music by those whisperings, so annoying in some places.
On the whole, this was a very fine concert; the orchestra playing was as near to perfection, I doubt not, as can often be found; and that constitutes the great attraction of the Gewandhaus. Every man seems to be able to play on his own instrument well; every man seems to give undivided attention to the music, and to endeavor to observe carefully, not only the time, as given by the conductor, but all those little gesticulations by which expression is indicated.

The next great event, and one which brought my first season through all its difficulties and dangers to a successful conclusion, was the reappearance of the great tenor Rubini, He was announced for a limited number of nights only, previous to his final retirement from the stage. The intense desire to hear the last notes of this long-established favorite of the frequenters of the opera, brought crowded houses, during every one of his performances, which commenced on the 13th of June, until the end of the season. In the ""Sonnambula,"" in ""Don Giovanni,"" in the ""Puritani,"" in the ""Matri- monio Segreto,"" in ""Anna Bolena,"" in ""Otello,"" in ""Cosi Fan Tutti,"" and in his favourite air from the ""Pirata"" (given on the nights when he did not appear in a whole opera), sung with an embroidery as delicate as Mechlin lace — in all these parts he was listened to with rapture, up to his final farewell.

At ten o’clock on the following morning I repaired to the church of S. Nicholas, where I found, as usual, the organist, Dr. Papperitz, true to his appointment. The instrument in this church is one of the largest and most varied in its character of the notable modern organs of Germany, and has four manuals and ninety registers. The organist kindly showed me its varieties of tone in a short improvisation, and afterwards, at the particular request of Dr. Papperitz and the musical persons present, I had the pleasure of playing for nearly an hour, and making my hearers further acquainted with English music, of which their knowledge seemed to be rather limited. Not­withstanding the great size of this instrument, I found its&nbsp;arrangement so good that manipulation was comparatively easy.

He went to Europe, and “talked the crowned heads ” (that was the popular phrase) “ into letting their crack ” military bands come over to play in the Jubilee. He obtained the band of the Grenadier Guards from London, about forty- five strong, under Dan Godfrey; a German infantry band, about thirty-five men, under Saro ; and that of the Garde Republicaine, from Paris, of about fifty-five men. It was said that this latter was reinforced by fine artists from the opera, and was not therefore a fair sample of French bands. There was also a little insignificant band, the Royal Constabulary, from Ireland.
These bands had an English day and German, French, and Irish days. The English band was good, the German, too brassy, the French, magnificent . The latter opened with Meyerbeer’s “Torch-Light Dance” ... and won instant success. They had a double quartette of saxophones, four fagotti, a double fagott, and some very large tubas: and the total result was so round, full, and soft, that all musicians were captivated with the deep diapason volume of sound.

The concert opened with an overture which is a great favorite here, and often played in public, though I have not heard it in America,— “Iphigene in Aulis,” by Gluck. It is a charming overture, and any one’s musical reputation might safely rest on the production of a single piece like this. Its subjects are at once natural and beautiful, and they are always treated in a most masterly manner; with elaborateness it is always intelligible, and with copiousness it is never diffuse. There is no departing from the main topic of discourse, no wandering in the mazes of thick darkness, or searching for ideas, but the leading thoughts are kept ever before the mind, presented now in this form, and now in that. Its analogies are perfect, its contrasts are striking, and its light and shade are applied with the hand of a Raphael or a Turner. It is full of pleasing melody, yet always subject to the laws of good taste, and manifesting both genius and science; it is in the performance, perhaps, equally satisfactory both to the musician and to the mere unstudied lover of song.
The second piece was an extract (first and second movements) of Cherubini’s Requiem, written for male voices. This, which is one of Cherubini’s great works, was written under circumstances somewhat exciting, as I remember to have heard years ago. On some funeral occasion when a Requiem was desired, that which he had previously written was rejected, because composed for a mixed choir; this caused him to put forth his energies, in the production of a mass for men’s voices only. The music throughout is of a very high character, though it would not much interest those who desire musical gratification only from pretty tunes or pleasant voices. The first movement, “Requiem aeternam” with its accompaniment of violoncellos and double basses, is plaintive and sad, and tells only of sorrow, penitence and grief. In the “Dies irae,” the full powers of the orchestra are brought into requisition; and uniting, as was the case on the present occasion, with sixty well-trained and fearless men’s voices, the effect was awfully grand and commanding. The majestic movements, the severely dissonant harmonies, the wailings of the strings, the frightful appeals of the instruments of blast and percussion, and the cryings out of the voices, all combined to produce an effect which was, at times, truly terrific and overwhelming. The nineteen stanzas, however, have furnished an opportunity for musical contrasts which have been well introduced, affording variety and relief.
The third piece was the very unique but, to the musician, highly interesting ""Concert fur 2 claviere (c moll) Von J. S. Bach."" Following the Requiem, it was like a delightful calm after a storm, enabling one to realize where he was, to breathe easily again, and put on a cheerful countenance.
Several part-songs were then sung by the “Mannerchor” without accompaniment.
The second part consisted of the “Sinfonie in C minor, by L. Von Beethoven” What a symphonie this is! We have often heard it, and it is well known in America. We will not attempt a description; we listened with intense interest to the whole of it, hardly daring to breathe in the piano and not having the power to do so in the forte passages. Is it strange then, that, whether “in the body or out of the body” at its close, we should not be able to tell?",1852-03-12TLl:ll:ll,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leipzig,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/f8b8dc14ebdc729dbaead11415d37fc6/1448281791569,Accompanied Indoor Public,http://musicbrainz.org/artist/f422b99a-b48c-4bee-bc0c-f2e8cad82b6c#_,Dr. Lowell Mason Lowell Mason,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Choir http://dbpedia.org/resource/Male_vocals http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Requiem

The dinner-party at the Embassy was a small one, no other company being invited except Mr. and Mrs. G ,Mademoiselle Lind, Madame Catalani and her daughter, and one English gentleman, a well-known amateur of the opera; the secretary of Embassy, and a sister of the Ambassadress being also present. After dinner, the weather being warm the party strolled in the garden attached to the Embassy — Catalani and Jenny Lind talking much together. In the evening, some little embarrassment arose about asking Jenny Lind to sing, because, as no one ever refuses a request made by the representative of majesty, the Marchioness considerately forbore to place the young Swede in a position of difficulty. But Catalani, who was burning vsdth curiosity to hear Jenny Lind sing, perceived that there was some hesitation, went up to the ""Nightingale,"" and asked her with grace and earnestness to oblige the company with a song, adding, ""C'est la vieille Catalani qui desire vous entendre chanter, avant de mourir !"" 
Such an appeal from such a person, overcame all Jenny's habitual dislike to sing in private society. She sat down to the piano, and after a few bars of prelude, gave her incomparable ""Non credea mirarti,"" playing the accompaniment herself. 
Now, the salon at the Embassy was exceedingly ill-adapted for vocal display, being crowded with stuffed sofas, chairs, and other heavy furniture, curtains inclusive. Jenny Lind's beautiful voice was consequently heard under sensible disadvantage; moreover, she had to sing in a sitting posture instead of standing up. Nevertheless, the many obvious merits of her style, taste, and execution enchanted the Italian ear of Catalani, who sat on the ottoman in the centre of the room, enjoying the rare treat, rocking her body to and fro with delight and sympathy, and murmuring (loud enough to be overheard by Mrs. G, who sat by her side), ""Ah! la bella cosa che la musica, quando si fa di quella maniera !"" — and again, ""Ah ! la carissima ! quanto bellissima !"" Of course expression of cordial thanks and admiration on the part of all present followed the performance; and before separating for the night, Jenny was good enough to sing one or two more ""arias"" (among which ""Ah! non Giunge"" was included), to the renewed gratification of the interesting ""ex-prima donna.""",1849-06-uu,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/a7c15226ad7a1fd189ae4c2002d6d183,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/ab0cdddc14bc23a1db50b0984a2b665c/1438769141617,Accompanied Domestic Indoor,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Angelica+Catalani/1438769014649,Angelica Catalani,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice http://dbpedia.org/resource/Piano,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aria

Dwight, the then accomplished editor and critic of the Commonwealth, gives the following account of the affair:
“THE MENDELSSOHN COMMEMORATION
“ The musical event of the season, at least so far as sentiment, artistic unity, and completeness, selectness, and novelty may be regarded, came off, in a way that more than realized expectation, at the Melodeon on Monday night. It was a pure festival of art a beautiful, sincere German enthusiasm inspired it and adorned it. The Quintette Club, prompted by the sentiment of the occasion, had sent free tickets to the three hundred or more subscribers to their chamber concerts. But almost thrice that number, at an early hour, were seated in the hall, which had been tastefully and significantly decorated. In large letters of evergreen the name * Mendelssohn ’ was displayed upon the front of the gallery, over the entrance, and on either side ‘ Born Feb. 3, 1809,’ and * Died in 1847/ In the centre of the circle, focus of all eyes and of all thoughts,—that is, in the front of the stage, before the organ,—that spot so often occupied by vain and showy solo players who seemed to place themselves before all music,—now rose the calm, pure, classic head of the true genius of the hour, a beautiful bust of Mendelssohn, crowned with laurel. We confess our thoughts were riveted to that intellectual, that unspeakably beautiful and expressive face, in whose fine and noble features one felt the union of a masculine dignity and firmness with almost a woman’s feeling. And then the large, clear, exquisitely moulded dome of thought, the perfect forehead! To tell the feelings that rushed through the mind and filled it all that evening, would require more than our power of expression. It should be a poem.
“ But the effect was first complete when the five young artists, with their instruments, had seated themselves around their patron saint, to interpret to us one of his quintettes. Then as the music, his own music, woke, the calm face elevated in the middle of the group seemed almost to open its eyes and move its lips; and who did not feel the music and the marble to be mutual interpreters, and that the great composer was thus doubly present to us ! The sentiment of the thing was so complete that the mind involuntarily hugged the spell; and any voice of conversation, even when a strain was finished, seemed an interruption.”",http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/day/1851-02-03,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boston,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/9b131394ecf6b3bae85ad2279b80d005/1450267411411,Indoor Public Accompanied,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/John+S+Dwight/1450266526136,John S Dwight,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chamber_orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chamber_music

The Carl Rosa Opera Company was performing in London about that time. Sir Charles Santley was a member of it, and it was while he was in that company that I heard him sing for the first time in the Trovatore, Fra Diavolo, and many other operas. His singing and exquisite phrasing were a revelation to me. I have heard him criticised as an actor, but at that time, as a singer, he was absolutely perfect. He possessed to a superlative degree all the qualities which make a singer stand head and shoulders above his contemporaries. The “timbre” of his warm baritone voice was quite beautiful, “simpatico” to the last degree, his technique superb (he had studied with Lamperti of Milan, the greatest professor of singing who ever lived, I suppose), and he had not only a great temperament, but he was a finished musician into the bargain, reading the most difficult music easily at sight, and able to express any and every shade of feeling. Whether the music were passionate or tender, graceful or virile, emotional or serene, sad or gay, he sang it with equal insight.",http://data.open.ac.uk/time/interval/1871-Ll-uu/to/1872-Mm-uu,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/bc180dbc583491c00f8a1cd134f7517b,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/e62b69a82c369a2ba8b79c55af320c99/1450873249436,Accompanied Indoor Public,http://musicbrainz.org/artist/eca4d562-1e5c-409a-89fa-5489d102cdcb#_,Maude V.

A full orchestra, and a large mixed choir of perhaps one hundred and twenty voices, with solo-singers, constituted the musical department for the occasion. The best speakers were employed for the declamation; and the living pictures were under the immediate direction of a committee of the painters of Dusseldorf. The hour arrived, but vain was the attempt to commence. Bacchus had been there, and had obtained such a sway over the sons of Apollo, that music’s voice could not be heard. The orchestra did indeed play, or appeared to play an overture, but not even the loudest passages could be heard, for the vocal shoutings quite overpowered trumpets, trombones, and drums. The speakers, in appropriate costume, came on the stage, but their voices were lost in loud shoutings, and they quickly gave up the contest and retreated. Various attempts were made for nearly an hour to command silence, and obtain a hearing, but in vain. The roar of voices, and the loud “ Hurrah,” overpowered all the efforts of the Mayor, the artists, and the orchestra.

The former took their places in the orchestra, but the solo singers came into the body of the Hall. This gave us a fine opportunity of seeing them all, and of shaking hands with some of them.
[...]
The rehearsal commenced at 11 o’clock, and (with the exception of the necessary intermission for refreshments) continued until nearly 12 at night. Such pieces only were taken up as were new, or not generally known. A part of Samson, a new posthumous motette by Mendelssohn, his fragment of an oratorio, Christus, and also of
Lorelie. Beethoven’s great 9th, and various other pieces belonging to the evening performances, were more or less rehearsed. Beethoven’s Choral Symphony occupied about two hours. It was evidently the piece for the success of which Mr. Costa felt the greatest anxiety — since it is the most difficult composition on the programme; and he spared no effort to make its performance perfect. It was originally written for the London Philharmonic Society; but it was not performed with any success until long after its production.
This rehearsal-day was full of interest and instruction, and afforded us an opportunity of standing a little behind the curtain, and of seeing something more of the principal vocalists than we otherwise could have done.

It is not indeed a new hall, but an old one repaired, painted, and ornamented; it is in the same house where Bach lived, and is the very room where Bach, Hiller and others labored and conducted musical performances. Hauptmann now occupies the same apartments which were formerly occupied by the great Fuguist. The exercises, with the exception of a short address by one of the pupils, were exclusively musical, as follows:
I. Prayer. ""Kommet Lasset uns anbeten"", Hauptmann
II. Motette. ""Der Geist hilft unserer Schwachheit, J.S. Bach
III. Four part-songs:-
1. ""O Thaeler weit, o Hoehen"", Mendelssohn
2. ""O sanfter, suesser Hauch"", Mendelssohn
(The above may be found in the ""Social Glee Book,"" and have been sung in the Boston Musical Conventions.)
3. ""Waldeinsamkeit"", Hauptmann
4. ""Ich stand auf, Berges Hoehen"", Hauptmann
IV. Motette. ""Jauchzet dem Herrn"", Schicht.
The singing was by the choir of the school and church, which consisted of about fifty voices; Soprano and Alto by boys. It was entirely without accompaniment. A grand Pianoforte in the room was only used to announce the pitch before each piece.
[... H]ere is a chorus who stand up and sing Bach’s and other most difficult motets, the most difficult vocal music perhaps ever written, by voices alone, with as much certainty as the sure aim of an experienced marksman.
I think I have never before witnessed such devotion to the work as in these singers. Here is indeed entire self-committal. Every one throws all the powers he has, physical and spiritual, into the performance of the music. Every tone is attacked with a conscious certainty of success; no matter how complicated the rhythm, it is given with an energy and truthfulness that a first-rate violinist can hardly excel. The singers seem to have a perfect command of their vocal organs, and are no less certain of results than is the accomplished pianist when he strikes the keys, or the violinist when he draws the bow. There is an entire absence of that sleepiness, drowsiness, inattention, and foolish levity too often witnessed in our choirs. No looking about, or whispering, or laughing, or silliness; but close attention is ever manifested. I wish I had words to point out that consecration to the work, that deep, heartfelt interest which these choir members seem to possess; so that it might be sought for by our American singers. [...] I have never before heard a vocal chorus so prompt, so energetic, and perfect in time and tune, as on this occasion. The place, too, was holy ground, for all the great musicians have visited that saloon; Bach lived there as his home, and Handel, and Haydn, and Mozart, and Beethoven have been there. A new portrait of Bach (or rather an old one put in perfect order) has been placed at the head of the hall, and opposite to it is a fine bust of Schicht, who, though less known, was a very profound musician, as his works testify. On the whole, I have not attended a more interesting musical performance in Germany.

To some of these I repaired in the evening; but there is no music to be heard in these places without eating and drinking yet all these gastronomic proceedings were carried on with such quiet and order that one's enjoyment of the music was scarcely ever marred.
One of the largest of the second-class theatres (the principal ones being closed at this period of the year) is the “Theater der central Halle.,, Here (the admission to the stalls being only 4d.) after a drama, which appeared to interest the large audience amazingly, came a concert of rather a peculiar description. Eight ladies appeared on the stage, with their stringed instruments in their hands, and, accompanied by the band, played, on violins and violoncellos, Mendelssohn’s “ Wedding March,” an overture, and other pieces, with a remark­able taste, precision, and effect, which elicited long and loud applause, the “ Wedding March ” being redemanded. The orchestra then played several pieces, and I may here observe how I was struck not only upon this occasion, but also at other times, by the excellent way in which the wood and brass instruments were played ; the tone invariably being softer and more refined than that of similar instruments in most of our own theatrical bands.

Then, on the 24th, was given ""Lucia di Lammermoor,"" for the debut at Covent Garden of a new light soprano who had been winning laurels at the Brussels Monnaie. This was Mme. Melba. For months we had been reading wonderful accounts of Mme. Marchesi’s Australian pupil, and curiosity concerning her vocal powers had been roused to a high pitch. It was not actually her first appearance before a London audience. She had sung two years before, under her own name of Mrs. Nellie Armstrong, at a concert at Prince's Hall (now the Prince's Restaurant in Piccadilly) ; but, beyond admiring the quality of her voice, I had not been much impressed by her efforts on that occasion. Augustus Harris also heard her in 1886 at the annual dinner of the Royal General Theatrical Fund, at which he presided. She had been introduced by Mr. Wilhelm Ganz, and sang, of course without fee, the “Ave Maria"" of Gounod. But it was not until nearly a year later that Harris was preparing his Drury Lane season, and then, naturally, he gave no thought to ""Mrs. Armstrong,"" who was working hard with Marchesi in Paris. Mme. Melba's initial success at Covent Garden was not wholly unequivocal. The audience, truly, ^ went into raptures and gave her an enthusiastic reception. But in the light of calmer judgment the critics took exception to certain “mannerisms” of style; and I, for one, while noting the extraordinary beauty of her timbre and her exceedingly brilliant vocalization, was fain to declare that her singing was “to an extent deficient in that indescribable something which we call charm”; that “her accents lacked the ring of true pathos""; and that, despite admirable intelligence, ""the gift of spontaneous feeling had been more or less denied her."" As an actress she still had everything to learn. In point of fact, it was not during this season that Melba began to build up the pyramid of her real London triumphs. The raising of that structure commenced only after another twelve-months of hard study and practical stage experience. &nbsp;&nbsp;",http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/day/1888-05-24,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Covent_Garden,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/10b327a03a9acb2deecf60a1051ebf28/1438425869240,Accompanied Indoor Public,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Hermann+Klein/1438157240872,Hermann Klein,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

It was on the Sunday, after prayers at St. Paul's, that we repaired to the tavern hard by. After dinner it was proposed that we should accompany Mr. Cooper to the evening service at St. Sepulchre's, where there is a fine organ. It was suggested that, if I were to ask Mr. Wesley to play at the conclusion of the service, he probably would. I said the request would come better from the king's organist than myself, but, as a stranger, it was urged that I was more likely to succeed. As we walked together I said, "" Mr. Wesley, these gentlemen wish me to ask you to touch the organ at the conclusion of the service; you may be a fine organist, that I know nothing about, but I am contented with you as a philosopher and man of letters, in whose company I have spent a pleasant day."" I saw, by a cunning leer at the corner of his eye, that I had pleased him by the remark, and the moment the service was over, with a smirk upon his countenance, he sat down, and began a noble fugue in the key of c# major. It was wonderful with what skill and dexterity he conducted it through the most eccentric harmonies.

The intense desire to hear the last notes of this long-established favorite of the frequenters of the opera, brought crowded houses, during every one of his performances, which commenced on the 13th of June, until the end of the season.

Mr. Villiers, the clergyman of this parish, is not only a very popular, but a very excellent and evangelical preacher; he has a large congregation, and the service throughout, on Sabbath last, was highly interesting. Of course the common Episcopal liturgy is used. The psalms are read, but at the end of each psalm, as is very common here, the Gloria Patri is chanted. The Canticles are chanted; though this day the “Jubilate Deo” was sung in anthem form by the whole congregation. The music was very plain, and rather quick; that is, about as quick as it is convenient to speak the words and observe a distinct and solemn utterance. This Congregational anthem singing is not common, though it is quite practicable. The Canticles were chanted by the whole people, and quite well done. Cadences no slower than the utterance of the words on the chanting note. Both the chanting and the anthem singing this morning afforded sufficient proof of the practicability of these forms of music in congregations; but it must be understood that the anthem was, as we have already said, very plain. We know of but very few sufficiently plain, contained in our American singing books. Two metrical psalms were sung, both well done — everybody taking a part. The organ was not very well played; the organist seeming rather to adapt himself to choir than to Congregational singing, and making too much variation of stops and of piano and forte in different stanzas.

Gilmore’s plans again showed his genius. They were bold, well conceived, but very costly. He went to Europe, and “talked the crowned heads ” (that was the popular phrase) “ into letting their crack ” military bands come over to play in the Jubilee. He obtained the band of the Grenadier Guards from London, about forty- five strong, under Dan Godfrey; a German infantry band, about thirty-five men, under Saro ; and that of the Garde Republicaine, from Paris, of about fifty-five men. It was said that this latter was reinforced by fine artists from the opera, and was not therefore a fair sample of French bands. There was also a little insignificant band, the Royal Constabulary, from Ireland.
These bands had an English day and German, French, and Irish days. The English band was good, the German, too brassy, the French, magnificent . The latter opened with Meyerbeer’s “Torch-Light Dance” ... and won instant success. They had a double quartette of saxophones, four fagotti, a double fagott, and some very large tubas: and the total result was so round, full, and soft, that all musicians were captivated with the deep diapason volume of sound. Their performance of the William Tell overture was superb.",180u-Ll-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boston,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/815ecac58e72a9be9a929cd064ef198e/1450281649542,Accompanied Public,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Thomas+Ryan/1448997315048,Thomas Ryan,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Military_band,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Military_march

Once, I remember, our party of four was joined by Tamagno when the celebrated Italian tenor was&nbsp;playing Otello at the Lyceum. We all had supper together after the performance and were in the &nbsp;joiliest of moods. Tamagno had a slight cold on &nbsp;the chest, but protested that it made no difference &nbsp;whatever in the singing quality of his head tones. &nbsp;Catarrh in the nose, he said, was fatal, but a chest&nbsp;cold made not the least difference to him. Upon this, Lassalle offered to wager that he could sing&nbsp;higher with his falsetto than Tamagno with his voce di petto. The challenge was accepted, and &nbsp;forthwith the two began a vocal duel the like of &nbsp;which I am certain I shall never hear again. Out came Tamagno's A's and B flats, as quickly &nbsp;responded to with the falsetto equivalents from &nbsp;Lassalle’s sturdy throat. Then the Italian went ""one better""; and the Frenchman, in order, as he &nbsp;said, to help himself up the scale, mounted his chair and emitted the B natural; whereupon Tamagno also stood upon his chair and brought out &nbsp;not only a high C, but a ringing D flat. Lassalle was now for mounting the table, but, this being &nbsp;“ruled out"" as an unfair advantage over a less athletic opponent, he proceeded to get the neces sary notes from the eminence of his chair, amid &nbsp;terrific applause from the rest of the company. Tamagno now made a bold dash for a D natural,&nbsp;but did not quite succeed; and as Lassalle fared no better, we pronounced the result a “dead heat.” Which, at that somewhat advanced hour of the &nbsp;night, was perhaps rather a blessing for the neighboring occupants of the hotel.",1888-uu-uu,,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/3e8ae225cee78a1e3064af35a50b276b/1438426737346,Indoor Accompanied Domestic,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Hermann+Klein/1438157240872 http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Edouard+de+Reszke/1438426676655 http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jean_de_Reszke,Hermann Klein Edouard de Reszke Jean de Reszke,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice,

The organ was well played, yet not always with sufficient strength to support and guide the congregation.

The choir in Mr. James’ church did not seem to be much in advance of the people in the manner of their performance; they tried to help the organ to lead, but no choir piece, either tune or anthem, was attempted by them. There was no chanting, as there is in many of the London churches, and metrical psalmody was the only form of song. Extempore parts were sung near to me, and especially by a gentleman who knew enough of music to sing always a third below the treble; this knowledge he took care to bring into practical use, and so, of course, was often producing fifths as much at variance with music’s laws as are nouns in the plural in connection with verbs in the singular number with the requirements of grammar. The first tune was St. Ann’s, with the good old-fashioned cadence on the mediant at the end of the third line—grand and effective; the second was St. Paul’s; the third we did not know, but while it was a pretty, “all's well"" kind of tune, it was unfit for Congregational singing, and an affected, fainting away, or “oh dear” result was the consequence. As in other places in England, so here, the hymn is just named, the organist then gives out the tune on his instrument, playing it through, then follows the reading of the hymn, after which it is sung.",1852-09-Ee,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/67819eec730342e5a7cbb6aa92af696e,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/72abd1e4df0c359b205a582182f59340/1448920678987,Indoor Public Accompanied,http://musicbrainz.org/artist/f422b99a-b48c-4bee-bc0c-f2e8cad82b6c#_,Dr. Lowell Mason Lowell Mason,Performance,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/thing/congregation http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pipe_organ http://dbpedia.org/resource/Choir,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hymn

Her intonation was perfect. Benedict had written for her a very long cadenza to fit the end of a cavatina from Beatrice de Tenda. The cadenza was sung without accompaniment; it covered two pages of music paper, and was written in a style suited to an instrumental concerto. Towards the end there was a sequence of ascending and descending arpeggios of diminished sevenths which flowed into a scale of trills from a low note to one of her highest; then dwelling very long on that note and trilling on it, she gradually, tranquilly returned to the theme of the cavatina, when it was perceived that her wonderfully fine musical ear had unerringly guided her through the mazes of the long cadenza and brought her to the tonic note of the piece with surprising correctness of intonation.
I think she was not overrated when called a “ great singer.”",180u-Mm-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boston,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/ac9a18bc764a9d44957905ff414f6ef3/1450272569260,Indoor Accompanied Public,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Thomas+Ryan/1448997315048,Thomas Ryan,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soprano http://dbpedia.org/resource/Female_vocals,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

I had conceived, ever since I had studied the life and works of CHOPIN, the greatest desire to hear him played by LISZT: indeed, the numbers of those CHOPIN still living who have had this privilege must be very limited. I ventured to say, ""CHOPIN always maintained that you were the most perfect exponent of his works. I cannot say how grateful I should be to hear, were it only a fugitive passage of CHOPIN'S, touched by your hand."" 
""With all the pleasure in the world“ replied the immortal pianist; and again I sat down by the grand piano, and humming to him a phrase of op. 37, I begged that it might be that. 
""I will play that, and another after it."" (The second was op. 48.) 
It is useless for me to attempt a description of a performance every phrase of which will be implanted in my memory, and on my heart, as long as I live. 
Again, in that room, with its long bright window opening out into the summer-land, we sat in deep shadow in perfect seclusion ; not a sound but the magic notes falling at first like a soft shower of pearls or liquid drops from a fountain blown spray falling hither and thither, and changing into rainbow tints in its passage, as the harmonic progression kept changing and tossing the fugitive fragments of melody with which that exquisite nocturne opens, until it settles into the calm, happy dream, which seems to rock the listener to sleep with the deep and perfect benison of ineffable rest; then out of the dream, through a few bars, like the uneasy consciousness of a slowly awakening sleeper, and again the interlude, the blown rain of double pearls until once more the heavenly dream is resumed. I drew my chair gently nearer, I almost held my breath, not to miss a note. There was a strange concentrated anticipation about LISZT'S playing unlike anything I had ever heard not for a moment could the ear cease listening; each note seemed prophetic of the next, each yielded in importance to the next : one felt that in the soul of the player the whole nocturne existed from the beginning as one and indivisible, like a poem in the heart of a poet. The playing of the bars had to be gone through seriatim; but there were glimpses of a higher state of intuition, in which one could read thoughts without words, and possess the soul of music, without the intervention of bars and keys and strings; all the mere elements seemed to fade, nothing but perception remained. Sense of time vanished; all was as it were realised in a moment, that moment the Present the eternal Present no Past, no Future. Yet I could not help noticing each incident: the perfect, effortless independence of the fingers, mere obedient ministers of the master's thought; the complete trance of the player living in the ideal world, and reducing the world of matter about him to the flimsiest of unreal shadows; and I had time to notice the unconscious habits of the master, which have already passed into historic manner- isms in his disciples, like CARDINAL NEWMAN'S stooping gait, GARIBALDI'S half closing of the eyes, or VICTOR EMMANUEL'S toss of the head. So I noticed the first finger and thumb drawn together to emphasize a note, or the fingers doubled up, then lifted in a peculiar manner, with a gentle sweep in the middle of a phrase things in which those are determined to be like the master who can be like him in nothing else ; also the peculiar repercussion resonance, since reduced to something like a science by RUBINSTEIN, and the caressing touch, which seemed to draw the soul of the piano out of it almost before the finger reached the key-board. When LISZT passed silently to op. 48, he arrived at some stiff bravura passages, which called forth his old vigour. Yet here all was perfect; not a note slurred over or missed; the old thunder woke beneath his outstretched hands; the spirits of the vasty deep were as obedient as ever to their master's call. With the last chord he rose abruptly; abruptly we came out of the dim, enchanted land of dreams; the common light of day was once more around me.",1880-uu-uu,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/018c7131fa6360859fb7a7b2b1a27e2a,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/42bbca8386e61b11743a80dc5527d8ce/1438006408706,Indoor Solitary Domestic,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hugh_Reginald_Haweis,Hugh Reginald Haweis,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Piano,

An Ohio friend related his experience to me. Jenny Lind was to sing in Wheeling, West Virginia, and he lived just sixty miles west, towards Columbus. He was then a boy of eighteen, and had been for three years apprenticed to a clock-maker. His father was a clergyman, with a large family and small salary, and though a warm-hearted music lover, was too poor to think of going to hear Jenny Lind. Father and son had read together a long notice of the approaching song-festival in Wheeling, and the father had remarked with a sigh of resignation, “ I wish I could hear her.”
The son determined to try and go to Wheeling for that purpose.
[…]
In short, my friend spent three days on the road to Wheeling, mending clocks by the way and getting a little money for each. He reached Wheeling, paid three dollars for his concert ticket, heard Jenny Lind, and returned home in a two days’ march. His father asked him where he had been, and he answered&nbsp; that he had walked to Wheeling, mended clocks, earned money to hear Jenny Lind, and was happy. The father saw that he had a son who was made out of good stuff, embraced him, and said not one word of reproof.",180u-uu-uu,"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wheeling,_West_Virginia",http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/f97d8a8f325ce44118c6078dabf9f0d5/1450268949574,Public Accompanied,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Unknown+listener/1450268888951,Unknown listener,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soprano http://dbpedia.org/resource/Female_vocals,

We have seen attempts to introduce, for example, some of John Sebastian Bach's harmony parts into congregations. Now, it is well known that Bach did not write harmony parts for Congregational singing, but for choir singing. In his church, the St. Thomas', Leipzig, all the people sing the melody, and the parts&nbsp;are sung (when sung at all) by the choir. Of course. Bach wrote such difficult harmonies as none but a choir, and a pro[f]essional choir too, can sing well. Yet editors not knowing these circumstances have introduced these difficult harmonies into tune books designed for Congregational use. Congregations might as well undertake to sing Beethoven's Mass No. 2, as these chorals, with all sorts of complicated and difficult harmony parts. Oh that two things in relation to psalmody might be understood! 1st. That Congregational singing cannot be good unless the tunes are very plain and easy; and 2d. That there are plenty of such plain and easy tunes which possess true musical excellence, and which are in all respects suited to the wants of a worshipping assembly.&nbsp;",18Mm-uu-uu,,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/df11257cf943a3e6ab8946d2a24ef929/1462035316271,Public Indoor Accompanied,http://musicbrainz.org/artist/f422b99a-b48c-4bee-bc0c-f2e8cad82b6c#_,Dr. Lowell Mason Lowell Mason,Performance,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/thing/congregation http://dbpedia.org/resource/Choir,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chorale

&nbsp;[…]
&nbsp;Early on Monday we resumed our heartless pilgrimage—wandering onwards, without any settled purpose or end. The busy, singing world above us was a nuisance; and around, the loaded fields bore nothing for us—we were things apart.

At the gloamin’ hour [sunset afterglow], we entered the village of Errol in the Carse of Gowrie.

I wondered, for a moment, whether the man was a preacher, and at a dead stop for material […], the bewilderment of his look certainly intimated that, what ever his employment, his lips had “closed for the season.” It was not so. I knew it all afterwards. He had been just then singing—for the first time, singing in the streets. I heard his song. Surely, surely, thought I, it comes from his very heart; such earnestness, such sorrowful sweetness! Misery makes niggards of us, and at times sympathies will actually become self-consumed; yet this man and his “Light of other days,” haunted my fancy, even to my motley lodgings.

The family assembled in a large room, denuded of its carpet, that the musical sounds might be heard to greater advantage. Our host being an accomplished violinist, and each member of his family playing some stringed instrument, there was here material for the performance of much excellent chamber music. First we had a classical overture, arranged as a duet for the pianoforte and a string quartet; then a violin solo, one of those charming romances by the old Italian masters, lately reprinted in Leipzig ; then a Trio of Beethoven’s, for pianoforte, violin, and violoncello ; then some vocal music, and for a finale, another overture arranged as the first.

An official announcement soon informed the delighted world, that although ""Mademoiselle Lind had intended to take leave of the subscribers and the public in a series of concerts,"" yet ""it having been urged that concerts would not be regarded as equally satisfactory,"" she had ""generously consented to suspend her intention of retiring from the stage,"" and would therefore appear in a few more performances. This resolution — a tardy one, scarcely compensating the inconveniences caused by previous refusals — was nevertheless hailed with satisfaction by both public and manager. 
On Thursday, the 26th of April, the would-be fugitive prima donna reappeared on the boards of Her Majesty's Theatre, in her great part of ""La Sonnambula."" Many of the self-styled ""interpreters"" of public sentiment pretended that the chain of sympathy which had attached her to the public had been too suddenly snapped asunder to be restored to its former strength; that the tide of popular feeling, untowardly checked when it had reached to such an unprecedented height, had been diverted, and would never flow in the same channel again. But all these suppositions turned out utterly ill-founded. Never had Jenny Lind been received with a more enthusiastic welcome, or with acclamations more fervent, from a house crowded to the ceiling, than on the night in which she returned once more to the stage. The scene of excitement was perhaps more agitating than any former scenes of bygone triumphs. It seemed not only as though a favourite idol had been restored to the public, but as if a child, whom some difference had temporarily estranged, had been received back to the arms of its family. In truth, the emotion on both sides appeared equally profound. The evening was signalised also, it may be said en passant (for every other consideration seemed utterly swamped in the one exciting event), by the first appearance of Signor Calzolari, an excellent and most satisfactory young tenor of (what was denominated) ""the good old school.""",http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/day/1849-04-26,,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/3b87d85fa3d79cf60f5b00326058d77e/1438771435326,Accompanied Indoor Public,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Benjamin+Lumley/1438607277398,Benjamin Lumley,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

Marien, a fine building, possessing one of the largest organs in Berlin, ably presided over by Herr Otto Dienel. The service and organ were both similar to those I had heard in the morning; the organ, however, was enclosed in a much handsomer and elaborately carved case. In the evening I went to the recently erected church of S. Thomas, which has an immense dome in the centre, and is most richly and profusely decorated throughout. Here I found a large new instrument of four manuals, built by W. Sauer, of Frankfort-on-the-Oder. The organist is Herr Succo, an admir­able writer of organ music, whose courtesy and kindness demand my warmest acknowledgments. The service began with a grand old chorale in G minor, and was of the same character as those I have mentioned above. After the service, the organist performed a “ Toccata” of his own, and in other pieces displayed the various qualities of the instrument, which was not so fine in the flue work as the older organs, but much superior in reed work and mechanical appliances, the pneumatic lever being amongst the most valuable.",1870-Mm-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Berlin,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/1a24c2600a90bea836739cc8e24a24d5/1465388253361,Indoor Accompanied Public,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Dr+William+Spark/1465384918944,Dr William Spark,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Organ_(music),http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chorale

Anticipating this, our company, consisting of three persons, went a little before the time appointed for the opening of the door; but yet we found a crowd gathered; the room filled immediately as the door was opened, but we succeeded in obtaining good seats. We had now to wait a full hour before the music commenced, but in the midst of such a multitude of good-looking and well-dressed ladies and gentlemen, all in conversation in loud and merry voices, it soon passed away. Half an hour before the commencement, the oboe was heard, running the scales, &amp;c.; this was soon followed by faggotti, corni, clarionetti, and strings; every man tuning and getting his instrument and his fingers in readiness. Mendelssohn seemed to look down from his bust immediately opposite the orchestra with approbation. At half-past six precisely, Kapelmeister Rietz takes his stand — the signal is given — every one is silent and attentive, and Beethoven’s overture (op. 124) fills the whole company with delight. This is a very pleasing overture; it is less learned, but of a more popular character than most of Beethoven’s. It is often marked with a rhythm like the music of the march or dance; and the flourishes of the brass instruments and drums almost lead one to suppose that he is listening to a military band. But still the hand of the master is seen, and although Beethoven comes down and freely holds conversation with the people, yet he always preserves his dignity, and never dishonors his profession in this pleasing composition.
A very good singer followed; Frau Leopoldine Tuczek-Herrenburg, from Berlin, in a Recitative and Arie from the opera of “Sylvana,” by C. Maria von Weber.
This was followed by a grand Concerto for the Piano Forte, with orchestral accompaniment (G moll), composed by J. Moschelles, and played by Clara Schumann. I have already spoken of Madame Schumann’s playing; her performance of this Concerto was perfect, and received the warmest approbation from the audience.
An air of De Beriot followed, by Frau Tuczek-Herrenburg; after which Madame Schumann played most charmingly a Notturno (B. major) for piano forte, by F. Chopin. In this she was encored, and played in answer to the call another piece unknown to the writer.
The second part of the concert was that in which the musical ones were most deeply interested, for it consisted of Robert Schumann's new Symphonie. This has not been published, and was played from manuscript, conducted by the author, who was cordially greeted on his appearance at the head of the orchestra. It is undoubtedly a work of great merit; but it is truly a great work, and can only be performed by a very thoroughly trained band. Its analogies and correspondencies are deeper and more hidden than in Mozart or Beethoven, but nevertheless they are there, and can be discovered to some extent even at a first hearing. The Symphonie consists of five movements, there being in addition to the usual movements a short adagio (fourth) introduced. In the second movement (scherzo), there is playfulness and relief, but throughout the whole the idea of greatness prevails; so much so as almost to oppress one with a feeling of grandeur and sublimity. The fourth movement especially seems to partake in the highest degree of this character, and stirs up the deep feelings to awe and reverence. But vain is any attempt at description, especially by one who has heard it but at a single performance. It was played with great energy; every member of the orchestra had enough to do. The captain inspired confidence, and the result was most satisfactory. There was but a momentary pause between the parts, and in this respect the learned conductor’s example is well worthy of imitation. The Symphonie occupied thirty-three minutes in its performance, and at half-past eight the concert closed.",http://data.open.ac.uk/time/interval/1852-03-uuT18:30:00/to/1852-03-uuT20:30:00,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/0a19459865ed69275723d6efb76048c9,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/79f1cf354f2cab7f4d37e01dfbcb6279/1448309691303,Indoor Accompanied Public,http://musicbrainz.org/artist/f422b99a-b48c-4bee-bc0c-f2e8cad82b6c#_,Dr. Lowell Mason Lowell Mason,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Overture

The opera-house is a noble building, standing in the immense square, opposite to the museum. I was told that I should hear “something anti- classical, neither Gluck, Mozart, or Beethoven; certainly not Bach, but Offenbach!” The opera proved to be La Belle Helene. The orchestra of forty selected players did more than justice to the sparkling and brilliant tunes of the lively French composer ; indeed, the accompaniment to all the songs was throughout delicate and artistic ; the principal singers were, however, scarcely equally excellent; the fair Helene, especially, indulging in an extravagant amount of tremolando on nearly every note she produced. To me the most striking part of the affair was the engrossing attention paid to every detail of the performance by the crowded audience; they seemed to know every point in the opera, and would evidently have made the performers aware of their knowledge, had they been guilty of any faults of omission or commission.",187u-Mm-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leipzig,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/d7ab03f528ec0224ddf0e5e2c1238889/1469024388257,Accompanied Indoor Public,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Dr+William+Spark/1465384918944,Dr William Spark,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

For no fewer than one hundred and &nbsp;sixty consecutive representations did “Ivanhoe"" &nbsp;draw large and enthusiastic audiences — far and &nbsp;away the longest unbroken run ever accomplished &nbsp;by a serious opera. Then, at the end of July, it &nbsp;was withdrawn, and the house closed until November, when an English version of Andre Messager's successful comic opera “La Basoche'' &nbsp;was brought out. This did fairly well, but it is &nbsp;noteworthy to-day only from the fact that it enabled Mr. David Bispham, by his clever singing &nbsp;and acting, to make a deep impression at his first &nbsp;appearance upon the London stage.

It is not indeed a new hall, but an old one repaired, painted, and ornamented; it is in the same house where Bach lived, and is the very room where Bach, Hiller and others labored and conducted musical performances. Hauptmann now occupies the same apartments which were formerly occupied by the great Fuguist. The exercises, with the exception of a short address by one of the pupils, were exclusively musical, as follows:
I. Prayer. ""Kommet Lasset uns anbeten"", Hauptmann
II. Motette. ""Der Geist hilft unserer Schwachheit, J.S. Bach
III. Four part-songs:-
1. ""O Thaeler weit, o Hoehen"", Mendelssohn
2. ""O sanfter, suesser Hauch"", Mendelssohn
(The above may be found in the ""Social Glee Book,"" and have been sung in the Boston Musical Conventions.)
3. ""Waldeinsamkeit"", Hauptmann
4. ""Ich stand auf, Berges Hoehen"", Hauptmann
IV. Motette. ""Jauchzet dem Herrn"", Schicht.
The singing was by the choir of the school and church, which consisted of about fifty voices; Soprano and Alto by boys. It was entirely without accompaniment. A grand Pianoforte in the room was only used to announce the pitch before each piece.
[... H]ere is a chorus who stand up and sing Bach’s and other most difficult motets, the most difficult vocal music perhaps ever written, by voices alone, with as much certainty as the sure aim of an experienced marksman.
I think I have never before witnessed such devotion to the work as in these singers. Here is indeed entire self-committal. Every one throws all the powers he has, physical and spiritual, into the performance of the music. Every tone is attacked with a conscious certainty of success; no matter how complicated the rhythm, it is given with an energy and truthfulness that a first-rate violinist can hardly excel. The singers seem to have a perfect command of their vocal organs, and are no less certain of results than is the accomplished pianist when he strikes the keys, or the violinist when he draws the bow. There is an entire absence of that sleepiness, drowsiness, inattention, and foolish levity too often witnessed in our choirs. No looking about, or whispering, or laughing, or silliness; but close attention is ever manifested. I wish I had words to point out that consecration to the work, that deep, heartfelt interest which these choir members seem to possess; so that it might be sought for by our American singers. [...] I have never before heard a vocal chorus so prompt, so energetic, and perfect in time and tune, as on this occasion. The place, too, was holy ground, for all the great musicians have visited that saloon; Bach lived there as his home, and Handel, and Haydn, and Mozart, and Beethoven have been there. A new portrait of Bach (or rather an old one put in perfect order) has been placed at the head of the hall, and opposite to it is a fine bust of Schicht, who, though less known, was a very profound musician, as his works testify. On the whole, I have not attended a more interesting musical performance in Germany.

The GREAT THEATRE of Parma was once among the wonders of Italy. It was built by the sumptuous Farnese adjoining the palace, and was capable of containing fourteen thousand persons. It has not, however, been used since the beginning of the last century, and is not even open for inspection. The little theatre, where operas were performing when we were at Parma, offered a striking contrast to this Ducal edifice. It was extremely small, mean, filthy, ill-lighted, and shaped like a double square, long and narrow. We were present at the performance of the popular piece of Paul and Virginia, with the beautiful music of Guglielmi; but there was but a scanty audience, a circumstance accounted for by the wretchedness of the performance. Here, as in almost all the Italian cities (Milan and Naples excepted), the choruses were filled up by tradesmen, who, for about ten-pence a night, after they lay by their leather aprons, assume the costume of the dramatic wardrobe. They execute the music of Rossini, Mozart, &amp;c. coarsely indeed, and vociferously, but not inaccurately.

Immediately following upon Madame Frezzolini, however, came a decided failure in the person of Madame Ronconi, for whose debut ""Torquato Tasso"" was produced. Unfortunately, Signor Ronconi (as rumour said, and for once, it may be affirmed, with singular correctness) was not allowed, by ""Caudle"" treaty, to play this great character with any other prima donna than his sposa. 
The part of Leonora, in ""Torquato Tasso,"" had been intended by me for Madame Moltini ; but on this same part Madame Ronconi had set her heart, and in this pretension the compliant husband supported her. I was compelled to yield the point, in return for concessions made on the side of Ronconi. Noble intervention was employed, nay, a dinner was given for the purpose of settling the mighty difference. The gratification of the lady's desire, however, produced the very reverse of the anticipated result. Madame Ronconi not only failed herself, but rendered her husband, who was thinking more of her than his own effects, so nervous, that he was unable to obtain, in his favourite part, that success which he might otherwise have achieved. 
Accordingly, ""Torquato Tasso,"" in spite of the undeniable greatness of the accomplished baritone in the principal part, failed to make any good impression. Other circumstances connected with the ""cast,"" apart from the fatal drawback of this lady's exigencies, contributed to deprive the opera of every chance of becoming a favorite on the London boards.",1842-uu-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Her_Majesty's_Theatre,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/834005aa44c3b2bb7ec69d13cf5cc5cf/1438609613867,Indoor Accompanied Public,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Benjamin+Lumley/1438607277398,Benjamin Lumley,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

They are held in a somewhat smaller room, and at a small subscription price, and are given only once in two weeks. The orchestra consists of about sixty talented musicians, and if Dreyschock and David are not seen leading the violins here as at the Gewandhaus, they, together with the other instruments, string and wind, are in the hands of artists of deservedly high reputation. The selections are also of the highest order, and the Euterpe presents its patrons with the works of the great masters in a style worthy of a Leipzig concert.
At a quarter of an hour before the time of commencement, the members of the orchestra were in their places, talking, tuning and getting ready. This, together with the general conversation of the people assembled, produces a buzzing chorus of great power — a chorus with which the Leipzig concerts commence. Every ticket was sold at an early hour, and of course every seat was occupied.
The concert commenced precisely at the hour appointed, with a new Sinfonie in E flat Major, in manuscript, by W. Westmayer, who conducted the performance. He is a young candidate for fame, who has been educated at the Conservatory here, and who is regarded as already a successful composer. The Sinfonie consisted of four parts, and occupied in its performance exactly thirty-eight minutes. I dare not attempt anything like a particular description of it, or comparison of it with other like compositions; it was listened to with good attention by a discriminating audience, and met a favorable reception. It seemed to me, however, to want light and shade, and variety in the treatment of the different subjects introduced. Parts of it were exceedingly interesting, considered in reference to modern combinations and contrasts of the different orchestral elements, but there was a too constant forte, and a too frequent reiteration of the tonic and dominant harmony, with brass instruments, in military rhythm — this, indeed, is a general resort of such composers as are sometimes at a loss for an idea, or in a similar condition with the public speaker who is obliged to speak, but has nothing in particular to say. I do not mean that Mr. Westmayer was minus thought, but still there was not such a flow as we often find in a Mozart.
The Sinfonie was truly good, and seemed to give much satisfaction — and yet I could not help thinking that it was an excellent preparation for the high appreciation of the next orchestral piece, which was no less an overture than the celebrated No. 2, C Major, to Leonore, and which was given with an effect far beyond what can be often heard.
The overture by C. M. Von Weber, to Oberon, was also played with such an energy and brilliancy as to take one’s breath away. The stillness of the pianos, the gradual and immense range of the crescendos, the thundering power of the fortes, with instantaneous contrasts and startling sfortzandos, were enough to work up the feelings to a perfect phrenzy. Wonderfully effective were these ever favorite overtures by Beethoven and Weber.
It was no small attraction of this concert that the piano forte was played by the Fraulein Maria Wieck, the sister of the celebrated Clara, wife of Robert Schumann. Mdlle. Wieck is a very superior player; she has not the strong hand of a DeMeyer or a Listz, but she has a most finished touch, and plays with great elegance and expression. Her first piece (hear it, oh ye of the exclusive modern school,) was nothing more nor less than Dussek’s 12th Concerto in E fiat major, the Adagio and Allegro movements of which she played — a most beautiful composition, elegant and tasteful in the highest degree, played both by the principal and by the orchestra as near perfection as such things can be done. There is nothing in the music to astonish, or to excite wonder or surprise, but there is that in it which is adapted to call forth perfect delight. It is full of peace, and innocence, and purity, and joy, and it is from beginning to end a constant appeal to the perception of the beautiful. I am no enemy to the modem school; it is indispensable to an accomplished pianist, and every well-educated musician will delight in it; but they err who suppose that in Clementi and Cramer and Dussek and Pleyel, there is nothing good or worth being saved. The fact is, the pianists, previous to him who is generally regarded as the head of the great modern school, had worked out a very satisfactory solution of the problem of piano forte playing, or certainly so if considered with reference to the more natural and legitimate powers of the instrument. Thaiberg, Listz, and others, have certainly much enlarged the boundaries, or the available capacities of the piano, but some of their followers have gone to extremes; so much so that there has seemed to be danger of losing altogether the ordinary effects of piano forte playing, or that they would he swallowed up in the extraordinary feats of left-hand melodies, flights of octaves, and the various methods by which amazement and wonder are excited. Thanks for the signs of returning soberness and good sense; we greatly mistake if other authors like Dussek are not yet to be brought back to the concert room, and to the parlor, to fill with delight the spirit of the true lover of music, and of the most beautiful of all keyed instruments, the piano forte.
A word to another class. There are some who condemn altogether the modern school, and who seem to suppose that all true musical genius left the world with Haydn and those of his day. Fraulein Wieck is not of their number, for while she played Dussek, in the first part of the concert, she played not Thalberg, or Listz, or DeMeyer in the second part, but Pagannini! Yes, the Carnival of Venice, arranged for the piano, and if music pleased legitimately in Dussek, the Fraulein excited no small degree of feeling by her exquisite touch, and facility of execution in the composition of the Prince of violinists. What if it be mere trickery; a dexterous artifice will always, at least, call forth admiration, and one does not always want to sit in sober judgment; and decide on the grounds of intrinsic musical merit — relaxation must be indulged, the beautiful give way to the ornamental, and true pleasure to mere amusement. If there is a time for all things, surely there is room enough for the old and new school of piano forte playing — yes, and for both schools of organ playing too, although this is not the place to dwell upon the latter.
There was still another interesting feature in the Euterpe&nbsp;Concert — it was the singing of Mdlle. Louise Wolfl. She sang an air from Stradella by Flotow, and also two German songs, the latter by Franz Schubert. A pretty singer, but not superior to several American vocalists.",1852-01-Mm,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leipzig,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/b71409bfdad19650e86953502f6cbce3/1448277163011,Public Accompanied Indoor,http://musicbrainz.org/artist/f422b99a-b48c-4bee-bc0c-f2e8cad82b6c#_,Dr. Lowell Mason Lowell Mason,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Female_vocals,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lied

It must not be supposed that the great prima donna of the season had been merged below the surface in this inundation of unexpected novelty. The ""Tempesta"" was still to be found ""upon the bills,"" and on the night of the 18th of July, Madame Rossi Sontag appeared for the first time in the ""Figlia del Reggimento."" Perhaps during her whole career at Her Majesty's Theatre, since her return to the stage, Madame Sontag had never undertaken a more hazardous part. The ""Figlia"" was so identified in the public mind with Jenny Lind, that it was impossible for Madame Sontag to escape comparisons on the part of a public which always will insist, against all the rules of true judgment, in making them. The Anglo-Italian stage had known no ""Figlia"" but its own cherished and petted daughter of adoption. The town still swarmed with coloured engravings and statuettes of its beloved ""Child of the Regiment."" But from this ordeal Madame Sontag came forthwith credit. Her exquisite grace and the perfection of her singing nobody questioned. But it was as the consummate actress, full of imaginative detail, and inventive bye-play, that she shone forth conspicuously. The public found that instead of one ""daughter,"" it now had two, and in spite of strong impressions of ""first love,"" could hardly decide which of the two it now loved the best.",http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/day/1850-07-18,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Her_Majesty's_Theatre,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/f4ff85c20792d00fe2014992f1d2b65d/1438784620480,Public Accompanied Indoor,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Benjamin+Lumley/1438607277398,Benjamin Lumley,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

On this last day of the year, there was a grand ceremony at the church of the Jesuits;—to sing out the old year—to offer up thanksgivings for all past blessings—and to solicit a renewal of them in the year to come. The crowd was immense, and the ceremony very impressive. There is a principle of equality in Catholic congregations, more consonant with the spirit of that religion which teaches that God is no respecter of persons, than the practice which prevails in our own church;—where the greatest distinction is made between the accommodations of the rich and the poor. The former are carefully separated from the contamination of the latter, into pews […] In the Catholic congregations there are no such invidious distinctions;—the rich and the poor kneel down together, on the same marble floor;—as children of the same Parent—to ask the same blessings, from their common Benefactor. All the congregation joined in the chant of thanksgiving, and I was deeply impressed by the touching solemnity of the ceremony. There is always something affecting in a large concourse of people participating in the same emotion; the feeling is heightened by the contagion of sympathy, and wound up to enthusiasm by the influence of numbers.",http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/day/1817-12-31,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rome,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/ae5132e6b2a8ac82bf25a3f5bd24c374/1518778755263,Indoor Accompanied Public,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Henry+Matthews/1518777337226,Henry Matthews,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Male_vocals http://dbpedia.org/resource/Female_vocals http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/musicgenre/sacred+vocal

Far more interesting in its way, although still not directly connected with the subject, was the appearance of the Queen in the theatre on the 31st May, being the evening after an insane attempt upon her life. The visit of Her Majesty had been expected. The opera house was filled in every part to overflowing; and on the entrance of the Queen the expression of enthusiasm was electrical. The whole audience rose to its feet, and one loud deep burst of congratulatory applause burst forth from the vast concourse of human beings. Hats and handkerchiefs were waved. Many ladies sobbed aloud. During this demonstration the Queen stood at the front of her box and curtsied repeatedly, while Prince Albert bowed in reply to the deafening congratulations. The audience would not allow the opera to proceed till the ""National Anthem"" had been sung, and, as a mark of especial respect, Lablache and Persiani joined the rest of the company. At the words ""Scatter her enemies,"" in particular, the most deafening acclama- tions arose, and one cheer more was raised when Her Majesty resumed her seat in the corner of the box. 
On this memorable evening, Mercadante's opera, ""Elena Uberti"" was performed for the first time in Italian, an English version, entitled ""Elena di Feltre,"" having been produced some time back at Covent Garden Theatre, during the engagement of Miss Adelaide Kemble.

The Don Jose of Jean de Reszke has been variously criticized. I hold the opinion, however, not &nbsp;only that it was, and still is, a superb embodiment, &nbsp;but that it did a great deal to restore to the character the musical and histrionic value which it had &nbsp;gradually been losing in inverse ratio to the ever-growing prominence of the central figure of the &nbsp;opera. For this reason I quote some lines that I &nbsp;penned anent M. de Reszke's impersonation at the &nbsp;time: &nbsp;&nbsp;
He showed us that it was as easy for one great artist &nbsp;to revive the importance and enhance the interest of a &nbsp;good role as for twenty mediocrities to drag it down to &nbsp;the level of their own talent. It goes without saying &nbsp;that the Polish tenor copied nobody's Don Jose in particular. He knew the traditions of the character, just &nbsp;as he learned those of Sir Walter von Stolzing by visiting Bayreuth. He read his Merimee and carefully studied &nbsp;his libretto; but like an artist of individuality and resource, he also thought the part out for himself. The &nbsp;result, curiously enough, was a conception more closely &nbsp;resembling Campanini's than any we have seen since. &nbsp;It was free from the melodramatic exaggeration into &nbsp;which other tenors had fallen. Take, as an instance, the &nbsp;last act. M. de Reszke did not make himself up like a &nbsp;starved ghost, neither did he rush about like a savage &nbsp;&nbsp;animal in a cage. He looked the picture of despair, and &nbsp;he made his piteous appeal to Carmen with the tone of &nbsp;a man who is yearning for love, not for an excuse to &nbsp;commit murder. When at last driven to extremities, he did not gloat over his revenge nor chase his victim from &nbsp;corner to corner as a cat might chase a mouse. He simply stood at the entrance to the bull-ring, and when &nbsp;Carmen made her attempt to escape, he seized his dagger as by a sudden impulse and stabbed her as she was &nbsp;endeavoring to pass him. An instant later he was leaning over her lifeless body in tears, horror-stricken at the deed he had committed. This surely was the true reading of the episode. Nor was it the only scene upon which &nbsp;M. Jean de Reszke, with rare artistic insight, contrived &nbsp;to throw a new and consistent light. He depicted with &nbsp;wonderful subtlety and skill the gradual stages by which &nbsp;Don Jose is drawn under Carmen's fascinating influence. Fierce and absorbing passion revealed itself in &nbsp;his facial expression, his gestures, and, above all, the &nbsp;thrilling tones of his voice. Never before has the beautiful passage where Jose brings forth the flower that Carmen gave him and tells her how it cheered his lonely &nbsp;prison hours, been invested with such charm of voice and &nbsp;such tenderness and warmth of delivery.",1890-07-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Covent_Garden,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/f647905f6a7857e186aa9c0c1883633f/1438443802133,Indoor Public Accompanied,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Hermann+Klein/1438157240872,Hermann Klein,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

The final rehearsal for the opening concert of the festival took place at the Albert Hall on May 5. Wagner had himself chosen the programmes. He was to conduct each first part, consisting of selections from all his operas, from “Rienzi” to “Tristan""; while Hans Richter, who now made his first appearance in England, was to direct the excerpts from “Der Ring des Nibelungen"" that formed each second part. Most of the preliminary work had been done under Mr. Dannreuther, in whom Wagner reposed great confidence. All that remained was to give the finishing touches and for the composer-conductor to accustom himself to the vast auditorium and the huge crescent-shaped phalanx of orchestral players spread before him. From the outset, as it seemed to me, he failed to place himself en rapport with either. The abnormal conditions appeared completely to upset him. In a word, he succumbed there and then to a severe attack of Albert Hall stage fright— an illness familiar to nearly every artist on stepping for the first time upon the platform of that gigantic amphitheatre. However, after a glance of astonishment round the empty hall, and a few whispered words to Wilhelmj, and yet a few more to Hans Richter (who was posted beside the conductor's desk), the great man raised his baton and gave the signal for the start. The inaugural piece was the “Kaisermarsch,"" and it was well chosen for the purpose. Its pompous and sonorous strains, proceeding with stately rhythmical movement throughout, were perfectly calculated to show off the imposing volume of the big orchestra in such a building as that. It gave no trouble, and the effect was superb. But, unluckily, instead of imbuing Wagner with a little confidence, this preludial essay left him more palpably nervous than before. 
The second piece on the list was the overture to the “Fliegende Hollander”. Here, I confess, I looked for something exceptional. I had always understood that Wagner was a fine conductor, at least of works with which he was in true sympathy, and I expected his reading of the “Dutchman"" overture to be in the nature of a revelation. Imagine, then, my disappointment and sorrow when it resulted in a complete breakdown! Twice—nay, thrice— did he make a fresh start, while Mr. Dannreuther and Mr. Deichmann (the faithful leader of the second violins) took it by turns to translate his complaints and instructions to the orchestra. But it was of no avail. He utterly failed either to indicate or to obtain what he wanted, and at last, in sheer despair, he threw down his stick and requested Richter to do the work for him. Well do I remember the sharp round of applause with which the band greeted the Viennese conductor as he mounted the rostrum. It was thoughtless—unkind, if you will; for it must have smote with unpleasant sound upon the ears of the sensitive composer. But the overture went without a hitch. It was played as I had never heard it played before.",http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/day/1877-05-05,,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/124f595552d489baaa6ab19cfc9a4937/1438189614764,Accompanied Public Indoor,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Hermann+Klein/1438157240872,Hermann Klein,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/March_(music)

A more interesting and more &nbsp;fortunate speculation was the series of representations of Verdi's “Otello"" given at the Lyceum Theatre in July, under the direction of Mr. M. &nbsp;L. Mayer, with a complete Milanese troupe— &nbsp;principals, chorus, orchestra, and even mise en scene— expressly brought over from La Scala, &nbsp;where the opera was first produced in February, &nbsp;1887. Tamagno and Maurel sustained their original parts, and for the former it was his London &nbsp;debut. The performance, exceedingly fine on the&nbsp;whole, was admirably directed by Faccio, the famous chef-d'orchestre of La Scala, who died a&nbsp;year or two later.

Yet in his inmost heart, I fancy, his famous sister, Malibran, reigned supreme. She was his junior by three years, but at the period here referred to had achieved triumphs unsurpassed by any singer of her time, and yet she had been dead and buried some forty years! He would describe her as the most natural genius he had ever encountered, and also the most precocious. A great deal that has been related concerning her is purely imaginary; but one perfectly true story is that of an incident which happened at Naples one night when, a little girl of five, she was playing the part of the child in Paer's masterpiece, “Agnese."" 
In this opera there occurs a scene where a husband and wife, who have quarreled, are reunited through the agency of their little daughter. The tiny Malibran had attended all the rehearsals, and so extraordinary was her memory that she knew the whole opera by heart. On the night of the performance, the prima donna, in the episode above mentioned, either forgot her part or hesitated a moment, when, lo! the little girl by her side instantly took up the melody and sang out with such vigor and resonance that the entire house heard her. The prima donna was about to interfere when the audience shouted, “Brava! Don't stop her. Let the child go on!"" And go on the child did, until she had sung through the entire scene, amid an exhibition of true Italian enthusiasm.",181u-uu-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Naples,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/222d2a7f2a808db6190e1c61157e98b6/1438165860503,Accompanied Indoor Public,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Concert+audience/1437737637011,Concert audience,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

Chicago, March 31, 1894. &nbsp;
My dear Friend: &nbsp;&nbsp;
In an artist's life every new role is a stage in that &nbsp;long journey toward the summits of art, toward the &nbsp;beautiful, the infinite. ''Werther,"" the other night, &nbsp;was for me one of those unanimous successes wherein &nbsp;the heart — the science of causing it to beat in one's audience and before one's audience — stood in true proportion &nbsp;to every artifice. The true path — that of emotion — that &nbsp;goal for which I am striving all my life — was reached &nbsp;in the presence of a public which did not understand&nbsp;the words, but which divined by instinct that my conception of the character arose from that simplicity, that &nbsp;pure, unexaggerated truthfulness which age and maturity alone can confer upon the thinking artist. . . . &nbsp;I am sending you the cuttings from the newspapers&nbsp;here; show them to Harris, who, I hope, will mount the&nbsp;opera for me. Mancinelli conducted the orchestra admirably. Eames and Arnoldson are two adorable little &nbsp;sisters. In a word, I believe that to the cultivated &nbsp;London public, accustomed as it is to novelties, it will &nbsp;come as a delightful surprise. I sing regularly three &nbsp;times every week, and my voice is excellent. At this &nbsp;present moment I am reaching my forty-first performance. Accept, my dear friend, from Edouard and myself, a thousand affectionate remembrances, together &nbsp;with a hearty shake of the hand. &nbsp;&nbsp;
Your devoted, &nbsp;&nbsp;Jean de Reszke.",1894-03-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chicago,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/383c8c713bd0c7c73c88a414fb9a5f1d/1438525623127,Public Accompanied Indoor,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Concert+audience/1438525531530,Concert audience,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

They consist of vocal and instrumental music, but without orchestra. They employ some five or six solo performers, and a choir of about forty-five choristers. Glees and madrigals are sung by the choir, and songs, duets, &amp;c., by the solo voices, with piano forte pieces, violin pieces, or other instruments as it may be convenient to obtain for the different concerts. I attended the second of the series on Thursday last. The large Exeter Hall was full of people, who seemed to be much delighted with the music; indeed I thought that there was more warmth of approval exhibited there than we usually see at the best concerts with us. The solo performers were Miss Pyne, Miss Louisa Pyne, Miss Binckes, Mr. Swift, (a new tenor,) Herr Jonghmans, Mr. Cotton, and Mr. Whitworth. Miss Goddard played serenade (Don Pasquale), by Thalberg, and also an andante and rondo capricioso by Mendelssohn, on the piano forte, and Mr. Richardson played an air with variations on the flute. Miss Binckes has a very fine voice, and sung to the great acceptance of the audience, and Miss Louisa Pyne sung quite a difficult aria by Rode, which called forth a most enthusiastic encore. The pieces for full choir were performed without accompaniment, not even the piano forte being played; and although I have heard a better chorus at home, yet this was truly good. The concert was conducted by Mr. T. H. Severn. The programme contained the music to the National Anthem, printed in full in four parts, and the whole audience joined in this the closing chorus:

The desire to hear Jenny Lind led almost to a riot at her final concert in Boston.
[…]
The concert was given in the early summer season, warm weather prevailing. Thousands of persons had perched upon the roofs of adjoining buildings and coal-sheds, and the streets round the depot were densely packed. The only means of reaching the concert room were the two corkscrew stairways at the front corners of the building. The reserved seat ticket- holders were allowed to go up into the hall first. Then at a given signal the dollar standees were admitted. There was one grand rush and the unreserved space was filled in the twinkling of an eye. People packed themselves very close, and yet there was continually a cry of “ Move up in front! ” with an awful pressure from behind by those who were trying to get in somehow, having paid for the expected privilege.
The time came to begin the concert. The orchestra played the overture, of which probably not a note was heard. Then came Signor Belletti. His song was simply pantomime and “dumb show.” Next came Jenny Lind. It was not her turn to sing, according to the programme, but Benedict brought her on to the stage, thinking her appearance would still the storm. It had a partial effect. She sang “ On Mighty Pens,” from the Creation. Towards the end of the piece, the people who were penned in the passageway between the offices, began to suffer from heat and lack of air. They smashed the glass partitions, had climbed in and opened the windows. The fracas and noise of breaking glass was frightful. A large number of ladies fainted; they were brought into the orchestra anteroom, and very soon overflowed into Jenny Lind’s room, so great was the confusion.
An effort was made to go on with the programme, but, to the best of my recollection, there was not another note heard after Jenny Lind’s song. People began to get out as best they could. It was a slow process. I know that we of the orchestra and the singers got out by corkscrew stairs at the stage end, the steps of which were all covered with mortar, laths, and pieces of joist. Providentially, the door at the foot of the stairs was unlocked, and we reached the street safely, with our instruments.",180u-Mm-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boston,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/9b4e47691cf1cddb668952821d5b252a/1450272905780,Indoor Public Accompanied,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Thomas+Ryan/1448997315048,Thomas Ryan,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soprano http://dbpedia.org/resource/Female_vocals http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oratorio

Jenny Lind appeared in the part which had first ""taken the town by storm,"" — in the part of Alice, in ""Roberto II Diavolo."" But, although the public seemed to care for nothing but Jenny Lind, and although all the interest of the opera centred in the great favourite of the day, that same public appeared to resent the mutilation of Meyerbeer's great work: 1st, by the entire suppression of the character of the Princess Isabella, and 2nd, by the omission of two complete acts. The revival was thus a failure in popular esteem, though not in remunerative attraction; for, as has been said, whenever, and whatever ""Jenny"" sang, the house was crowded to its farthest limits. The ""cast,"" it must be said, lacked the completeness of the previous year, Gardoni (the Raimbaldo of the previous season), favourite though he was, was pronounced not up to the part of Roberto; whilst Beletti, although usually applauded by the.audience in other characters was judged deficient in the depth and intensity necessary to Bertram. Labocetta, the new Raimbaldo, also failed to please. The experiment of the revival of ""Roberto il Diavolo,"" under these conditions, was, therefore, anything but prosperous.",1848-uu-uu,,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/b7a3a8bc08cf20995a4d026b4ede75e7/1438765769693,Indoor Accompanied Public,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Benjamin+Lumley/1438607277398,Benjamin Lumley,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

By the way, Malten and Gudehus were again in London in 1886, when they sang at the Richter Concerts in long excerpts from “Tristan” and “Siegfried”, supported by Pauline and Georg Henschel. I never cared particularly for the tenor— his voice was always hard and metallic; but Malten's noble organ was never in grander condition, and she sang with a degree of dramatic intensity and emotional warmth that was absolutely thrilling.",1886-uu-uu,,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/0d75ebb93bb7ff851dd17a88be5bb45d/1438265306324,Accompanied Indoor Public,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Hermann+Klein/1438157240872,Hermann Klein,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

The enchanting monotony of tlie customary operatic repertoire, in which ""La Gazza Ladra,"" with Grisi, ""Linda di Chamouni,"" with Castellan, ""Lucrezia Borgia"" and ""Otello,"" with Mario, succeeded the old favourites already cited, was broken at last on the 24th of June, by the appearance of Barroilhet and Madame Rossi Caccia in ""Roberto Devereux,"" Both came before the English public with a very high reputation, and consequently were worthy and legitimate engagements for a director of Her Majesty's Theatre, anxious to lay all available talent of note before his subscribers and his public. Neither, however, achieved any notable success, or made any very durable impression. M. Barroilhet was the favourite and admired baritone of the Academie of Paris. On the boards of the Parisian grand opera his reputation was immense. As the king in ""La Favorita,"" and the mad monarch in Halevy's opera of ""Charles VI”, he had been proclaimed without an equal. 
He came to London, however, with power somewhat impaired by time and exertion, still more by recent severe illness. Moreover, the role of ""Nottingham"" (though originally composed for him) was less favourable to his style than the parts in which he obtained repute in Paris. He appeared in two operas only, and then returned to France to recruit his failing health. 
The lady above-named, who had ""led the business"" both at the Opera Comique and at the Grand Opera, of Paris, and who afterwards achieved successes on different continental theatres (especially at Lisbon, where she was the favourite prima donna of the day), scarcely succeeded in maintaining the position she had previously acquired when she came before the somewhat spoiled, and always fastidious, audience of Her Majesty's Theatre.

[Letter VIII]
The denomination of stanze or saloons, is applied to an establishment formed by the middle ranks of the city, in opposition to the cazina of the nobility; the latter, indeed, only comprises a small number of the community, and the nobles frequently abandon it for the stanze of the citizens, where more freedom and gaiety reign than in their own circle, over which, it is said, the pretensions of etiquette throw a coldness and constraint; the founders of the stanze bear all the expense, and admit such persons as are presented to them; here, for conversation, there are various rooms, which are filled with good company; here are news-rooms, billiard-rooms, ball-rooms, and also a garden; in short, nothing is wanting to render the place agreeable; the evening flies in circle of varied and decent amusements; the building communicates with one of the theatres, so you may walk thither under the arcade and hear a song, return and eat an ice, join in conversation, or figure in a dance.",17Ll-uu-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Florence,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/43666bce0ba9aa60e9d92b86b7f39ed1/1517908072792,Indoor Accompanied Public,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Antoine+Laurent+Castellan/1517842957331,Antoine-Laurent Castellan,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice,

One night we all went up to Anacapri, where several fishermen and girls danced a tarantella for us. The music was absolutely irresistible ! We looked on for some time, and then we began to realise that, after all, we were neither of us Methuselahs !
“Come on,” cried Munthe. “Why shouldn’t we dance too ?”
I hesitated for a moment. I didn’t know the steps, and said so.
“What does it matter ? Just let yourself go to the music ! Corraggio ! Avvanti!”
How we danced under that vine-covered pergola ! It was a splendid moonlight night - there wasn’t a breath of wind. Naples was visible in the distance with its flaming girdle of lights, and the contrast between our moonlit, star-lit mountain ball-room, and the glittering town, from which the sea divided us, was too beautiful for words. Every ten minutes or so one of the pretty, dark-eyed girls went round with wine, and we were obliged to make a pretence of sipping at the tumbler every time, or our hosts would have felt aggrieved. At last I had to give in. I had danced till I could dance no more, and we still had to walk down to the Marina to our little inn by the sea.",1888-Ee-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anacapri,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/93414c0fc6bdc52f40e95af78a0c89d1/1476602079004,Accompanied Outdoor Public,http://musicbrainz.org/artist/eca4d562-1e5c-409a-89fa-5489d102cdcb#_,Maude V.

For no fewer than one hundred and &nbsp;sixty consecutive representations did “Ivanhoe"" &nbsp;draw large and enthusiastic audiences — far and &nbsp;away the longest unbroken run ever accomplished &nbsp;by a serious opera. Then, at the end of July, it &nbsp;was withdrawn, and the house closed until November, when an English version of Andre Messager's successful comic opera “La Basoche'' &nbsp;was brought out. This did fairly well, but it is &nbsp;noteworthy to-day only from the fact that it enabled Mr. David Bispham, by his clever singing &nbsp;and acting, to make a deep impression at his first &nbsp;appearance upon the London stage. D'Oyly &nbsp;Carte now doubtless imagined that he possessed &nbsp;the foundation of a repertory, and he revived &nbsp;“Ivanhoe'' to run alternately with “La Basoche""— Barton McGuckin filling the title-role, &nbsp;while Medora Henson was the Rowena, But the &nbsp;public quickly undeceived the too sanguine manager. It stayed severely away. The drawing power &nbsp;of Sullivan's beautiful opera had been exhausted; &nbsp;and on January 16, just a fortnight short of &nbsp;twelve months after its auspicious opening, the &nbsp;“Royal English Opera'' was finally closed — the &nbsp;strangest commingling of success and failure ever &nbsp;chronicled in the history of British lyric enterprise!",http://data.open.ac.uk/time/interval/1891-01-uu/to/1892-01-16,,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/b8409538192615334bd1753c22c59de0/1438521607779,Accompanied Public Indoor,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Hermann+Klein/1438157240872,Hermann Klein,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

On one memorable occasion Rubinstein and Wieniawski did me the honor to spend an evening at my house in Boston. A right royal musical evening it was, shared by about fifty artist and amateur guests. We made much music,—beginning with Rubinstein’s String Quintette in F, op. 57. Then we had the Rasoumoffski Quartette in F, op. 57, by Beethoven, with Wieniawski playing first violin. Then the Schumann Piano Quintette, with Rubinstein at the piano. Oh, it was a joy to take part with such a man and in such a work! and how Rubinstein did spur us on by his passionate way of playing some of the great parts! his power was fierce and tremendous. I think we all revelled in the sea of sound we made about us.
After the Quintette, Rubinstein played a lot of choice solo pieces, ending the evening with the Chopin Polonaise in A flat, op. 53, in which comes the wonderful passage for the left hand in octaves. He began the phrase very soft, then the “little-by-little crescendo” was most admirably done, finally reaching a fortissimo power which was quite colossal. It stirred us all up, and set even the chandelier to jingling in sympathy, and possibly in admiration.",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boston,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/281deaa83d3a533108cf58af62acfd5c/1449477694430,Domestic Indoor Accompanied,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Thomas+Ryan/1448997315048,Thomas Ryan,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Piano,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_music

Under these favorable circumstances, two new operas by English composers were brought to a hearing, namely, Arthur Goring Thomas's “Esmeralda” and Alexander C. Mackenzie's “Colomba”. It was purely an experiment, and Carl Rosa himself had little faith in its success. I remember his saying: “I look upon this as a duty that I owe to native art, and not as a business speculation. Mind, both these operas are interesting and beautiful, or I should not have accepted them. But they are by British composers— by men whose names are hardly known to the public. How, then, can I dare hope they will succeed?"" And yet they did succeed— “Esmeralda"" by virtue of graceful, emotional strains allied to a moving and ever-effective drama; “Colomba"" on the strength of musical merits that overcome, temporarily at least, the incubus of a clumsy and ponderous libretto.",1883-uu-uu,,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/340049c80b8686c55950d24e58423100/1438252496183,Accompanied Indoor Public,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Hermann+Klein/1438157240872,Hermann Klein,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

Dead tired, hungry, without even a chance to wash our hands or brush our hair, and wearing clothes in which we had travelled, we unpacked our instruments and music, and went through the entire programme, doing our best to play and sing for the pleasure of the large audience.

The drivers brought up word, “ Not aboard,” and then learned we had come overland and were performing on the stage. When starting from Winona we could not telegraph, as the wires were down.

Sontag, by marriage the Countess Rossi. The weather was unfavorable, being rainy, and the streets were muddy. I took my place at the door of the Gewandhaus at half-past four, where the people were then gathering. By five, when the outer door was opened, a multitude had assembled, and immediately rushed into the house, filling the long stairway and entry. Here was another interval of waiting, until half-past five, when the door of the hall was opened, and the room was immediately filled. We had now to wait another hour, or until half-past six; when the performance commenced with a Symphonie, by Joseph Hadyn in C, very light, playful, and pleasing, but lacking the depth of a Beethoven or a Mendelssohn. It is so easy a composition, that it seemed to be quite children’s play for the orchestra, who yet rendered it in the most perfect manner possible. This was followed by an Arie from “Rinaldo” by Handel; a most charming song indeed, and as charmingly sung by Mad. Sontag. Of Mad. Sontag’s singing, I dare not speak now. I will only say that no one can have a more perfect execution; but to say in what her excellence consists, as a singer, or what are the peculiarities of her style, must not now be attempted.
The third piece was “Romanze for the Violin,” by Beethoven; performed by Herr Concertmeister, Ferdinand David. This is the David whose compositions for the violin are so well known, and whose reputation as a player is so extensive. Mad. Sontag then sang ""Bel raggio lusinghier,"" from Rossini’s Semiramide, a song requiring the greatest powers of vocalization; this was perfectly given by the inimitable artist.
The second part consisted of the Overture and a long scene from Gluck’s famous “Iphigenie in Tauride;"" the principal vocal part being that of Iphigenie by Mad. Sontag. Gluck has not been heard with us, but he ranks in the very first class of composers here. The overture is a magnificent concert piece, and it was performed by this fine orchestra with wonderful precision and effect. Beethoven’s Overture to Egmont closed the musical entertainments of the evening, and well repaid one for his Two Thalers, (cost of a ticket,) and for all the previous waiting, wetting, and crowding necessary to secure a place to stand up.",1852-02-Mm,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/0a19459865ed69275723d6efb76048c9,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/fe4b3d2740020d7844cc552733c92cbe/1448278707582,Indoor Public Accompanied,http://musicbrainz.org/artist/f422b99a-b48c-4bee-bc0c-f2e8cad82b6c#_,Dr. Lowell Mason Lowell Mason,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Violin,

She is one of the very few young wonders who developed into great artists at maturity. Jaell was a splendid pianist. If he were playing at the present day, he would bear comparison with the greatest living players.

They passed through Medstügan one day, and a tiny little woman belonging to the company came to the cottage where DD. [Miss Edith Balfour] and I were staying. We were in the garden, and she saw one of the guitars lying on a bench near us. She picked it up eagerly and brought it to us.
“Play, play! ” she said in Swedish.
I took it up and said to DD., “Let us sing her that little German Volkslied, ‘Verlassen, Verlassen.’”
She didn’t take her eyes off us from beginning to end. She seemed utterly lost to everything else around her. As we finished the tender little melody, to which I sang an alto part, she suddenly buried her face in her hands and burst into tears ! She cried and cried, till we felt quite distressed.

An imperial request being equivalent to a&nbsp;command, Liszt sat down to the piano and commenced&nbsp;one of his brilliant Hungarian Rhapsodies. The Czar,&nbsp;instead of bestowing that exclusive attention upon the&nbsp;performance to which Liszt was accustomed, and which,&nbsp;in fact, he exacted from his audiences in private as well&nbsp;as in public — no matter of what exalted elements they&nbsp;might happen to be composed— entered into an animated&nbsp;conversation with one of his generals, talking in his&nbsp;usual and by no means subdued tone of voice. Liszt&nbsp;went on playing for a minute or so, at the expiration of&nbsp;which time, seeing that the Emperor was not listening&nbsp;to him, he suddenly came to a full stop, and rose from his&nbsp;seat at the instrument. Tableau! Although he had paid no heed to Liszt's performance, Nicholas Alexandreivich&nbsp;missed the sound of the piano, and sent one of his chamberlains to ask the artist why he had ceased playing —&nbsp;whether he was indisposed or the piano had not been&nbsp;properly tuned. Liszt's steely grey eyes flashed with&nbsp;righteous indignation as he replied: ""The Czar well&nbsp;knows that whilst he is speaking every other voice— even&nbsp;that of music — is bound to be mute!"" So saying, he&nbsp;turned his back on the astounded official, and abruptly&nbsp;left the room. Everybody present expected that the&nbsp;maestro would receive his passport the first thing on the&nbsp;following morning, with the peremptory order on the&nbsp;part of the Minister of Police to quit Russian territory&nbsp;within four-and-twenty hours.

Night after night I played him [Mr. Rose-Innes] scenes out of all these operas, endeavouring to the best of my ability to reproduce the vocal and orchestral effects I had heard at the theatre, and referring as little as possible to the dull pianoforte arrangement before me. If I didn’t play a solo with all the tenderness, or charm, or brio with which some great singer had sung it, he would stop me over and over again. “No, no, you haven’t got it; don’t you remember the splendid virility with which he simply brought the house down with such and such an aria? Don’t you remember how she lingered on that note?” Or, “Try and make that finale sound as if there were a crowd of people singing,” etc. etc. And I took to this Italian operatic music like a duck to water. There was something emotional in it that appealed to the youth in me, and I loved to try and make the piano a living and breathing human voice. That my playing of these scores gave real pleasure to someone very dear to me was in itself a powerful incentive. Perhaps the actual music only stirred me on the surface - still, even surfaces are facts that cannot be denied, and have to be reckoned with. And I adored, with every reason, the really beautiful singing I heard so constantly; my love of vocal music grew apace, and in my admiration for the singer I often failed to detect the flimsy quality of the music.",18Mm-uu-uu,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/bc180dbc583491c00f8a1cd134f7517b,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/6bdcb760f2238253ed504e1d86fe6f8c/1476550950821,Domestic Accompanied Indoor,http://musicbrainz.org/artist/eca4d562-1e5c-409a-89fa-5489d102cdcb#_,Maude V.

Jullien was just the man for the period in which he worked, and certainly he thoroughly exploited his versatility […] He had a dais built in the centre of the orchestra, the floor of which was covered with white cloth having a gold-lace border. On the dais he had a splendid arm-chair of white and gold. When he directed, he stood up and faced the audience, his string forces being on either hand, part way between him and the audience, but leaving him in full view; and the wood and wind were on each side, with the brass in the rear.
In conducting dance music or anything of a distinctly rhythmical character, he would mark the rhythm so graphically with his baton that people actually saw it at the end of his stick.

Their venture was a fiasco. The orchestra numbered about twenty-five. They did not play so well as the Germania, consequently did not have the elements of a possible success. About the only souvenir I have of their visit is the hour I spent at the first rehearsal of the new waltz Traum des Oceans—a fine waltz, probably Gungl’s best, which was written while on his voyage to America. Gungl did not give many concerts in Boston, and I think that shortly after his visit he returned to Germany.

[Rev. Thomas Starr King, pastor of the Hollis Street Church] was passionately fond of music. I remember that when Mr. J. Trenkle was organist of the church, it was part of the musical programme that after the second hymn the organist should make an extensive improvisation or play some set piece of fine music. Mr. King believed it was as worthy a jubilate as any human speech could utter; and that good music, artistically given attuned his moral and mental faculties to a fine spiritual state, and invigorated him for the sermon yet to be delivered.",185u-Ee-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boston,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/3648c2c0772fabc75ab2213f5e4edb44/1450274201250,Indoor Public Accompanied,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Thomas+Ryan/1448997315048,Thomas Ryan,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Organ_(music),http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_music

There was a curious society or club established in Dublin, which had existed I believe some time, but to which the growing political excitement of the day lent a new and humorous interest. A mere sketch of the plan and objects of the club (to which most of the gay fellows of the middle and liberal class of society belonged) will show what a fertile source it afforded not only of fun and festivity, but of political allusion and satire. The island of Dalkey, about seven or eight miles from Dublin, was the scene of their summer réunions, and here they had founded a kingdom, of which the monarchy was elective; and at the time I am speaking of, Stephen Armitage, a very respectable pawnbroker of Dublin, and a most charming singer, was the reigning king of the island. Every summer the anniversary of his coronation was celebrated, and a gayer and more amusing scene (for I was once the happy witness of it) could not be well imagined.&nbsp; About noon on Sunday, the day of the celebration, the royal procession set out from Dublin by water; the barge of his majesty, King Stephen, being most tastefully decorated, and the crowd of boats that attended him all vying with each other in gaiety of ornament and company. There was even cannon planted at one or two stations along the shore, to fire salutes in honour of his majesty as he passed. […]
The ceremonies performed in honour of the day by the dignitaries of the kingdom, were, of course, a parody on the forms observed upon real state occasions; and the sermon and service, as enacted in an old ruined church, by the archbishop (a very comical fellow, whose name I forget) and his clergy, certainly carried the spirit of parody indecorously far. An old ludicrous song, to the tune of “Nancy Dawson,” was given out in the manner of a psalm, and then sung in chorus by the congregation; as thus, —
&nbsp;
“And then he up the chimney went,The chimney went — the chimney went;And then he up the chimney went,And stole away the bacon.”
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
There were occasionally peerages and knighthoods bestowed by his majesty on such “good fellows” as were deserving of them; on this very day which I am describing, Incledon the singer, who was with a party on the island, was knighted under the title of Sir Charles Melody. My poetical friend, Mrs. Battier, who held the high office of poetess laureate to the monarch of Dalkey, had, on her appointment to that station, been created Countess of Laurel.

The event of 1876 was, I suppose, unprecedented in the annals of Modern Art. I have devoted to it a separate notice. It was my privilege to witness the first unfolding of those four colossal musical dramas of the Nibelung's Ring on the Bayreuth stage. People had assembled from all parts of the civilised world; kings, princes, and nobles mingled in that motley throng. The dramas lasted every day from four till ten, with intervals of an hour between the acts. The whole population lived only in the life of that great cycle of tragedies in which gods, demi-gods, and mortals acted out, with more than earthly intensity, the perennially interesting dramas of human life and passion.",1876-uu-uu,,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/890e0da28e1cd39c80a6021ff748342f/1437988615228,Public Accompanied Outdoor,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hugh_Reginald_Haweis,Hugh Reginald Haweis,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

In addition to the events already recorded, there belong to the years 1877 and 1879 some experiences which, for me at least, will ever be replete with interest. In the earlier year I heard for the first time Anton Rubinstein and Pablo Sarasate, and witnessed the debuts of Etelka Grerster and Gayarre. With the exception of a brief visit in 1876, Rubinstein had not been in London for seven or eight years. I now heard him at the Philharmonic, at the Crystal Palace (where I saw him conduct— with all the “extra"" movements included— his grandiose but interminable “Ocean” symphony), and at some recitals at St. James's Hall. He was then in his forty-eighth year, and had attained the fullest measure of his extraordinary powers.",1877-uu-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Crystal_Palace,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/2ff3b3b0bd9c94b6c95c6f76ac6de033/1438247232934,Public Accompanied Indoor,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Hermann+Klein/1438157240872,Hermann Klein,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Symphony

&nbsp;*The villa Santa Anna is the favourite summer-residence of the Marchesa Theresa Pallavicini. We were present there at one of the most picturesque fêtes that can well be imagined, and in which Religion accidentally mingled her rites, with a very singular effect. It was the feast of Saint Anne—the saint-day of the younger Marchioness (daughter-in-law to Madame Pallavicini), in honour of whom the entertainment was given. As we were carried up the steep and dark acclivities, on the summit of which the villa and its gardens, brilliantly illuminated, blazed like meteors, we observed several little shrines, erected by the votarists of the Saint, lighted with wax tapers and decorated with flowers. Bands of children and young women sang&nbsp;choruses, and suffered them to fade away in dying cadences, which were taken up by other groups, and echoed back.
&nbsp;The entertainment at the villa was a concert, ball, and supper—the two latter under an awning,and in the open air, delicious from the softness of evening and the profusion of flowers.

The Germania held together about six years —most of the time in Boston. They made many short trips in New England, and one tournde with Jenny Lind. Their summers were profitably spent in Newport In the last two seasons they added as stars the famous girl violinist, Camille Urso, and Alfred Jaell, pianist Madame Urso is too well known to need any eulogy at my hands. She is one of the very few young wonders who developed into great artists at maturity. Jaell was a splendid pianist. If he were playing at the present day, he would bear comparison with the greatest living players. When the Germania disbanded, he went to Paris, made his home in that city, and won a popularity which he never lost. He died very recently.

With the tip of his bow he sent off the orchestra in a grand military movement with a force and vivacity as surprising as it was new. At the termination of this introduction he commenced with a soft streaming note of celestial quality, and with three or four whips of his bow elicited points of sound that mounted to the third heaven and as bright as the stars... He has long legs and arms, and his hands in his playing often assume the attitude of prayer, with the fingers pointed upwards.

Though generally resident at Turin, he has no fixed engagement; but, as occasion may require, makes a trading voyage through the principal cities of Italy, and can always procure a theatre, upon the condition of equal participation in the receipts. Many stories are told of the means by which he has acquired his astonishing style;—such as his having been imprisoned ten years with no other resource— and the like. But, however this may be,&nbsp;his powers over the violin&nbsp;are most extraordinary.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
* I subjoin the spirited description of a friend, whose musical science and acknowledged taste enable him to speak with much more authority than myself. "" Paganini's performance bears the stamp of the eccentricity of his character. As to mechanism, it is quite perfect; his tone and the thrilling intonation of his double stops are electric; his bow moves as if it were part of himself, and endued with life and feeling; his&nbsp;staccato&nbsp;is more strongly marked than I ever knew, and in the smoother passages there is a glassiness, if one may so say, which gives you the notion of the perfection of finish, and the highest refinement of practice. Though, in general, there is an ambition to display his own talents, by an excess of ornament, yet he can, if he will, play with simplicity and pathos, and then his power over the passions is equal to that of any orator or actor.""

As we re-ascended, the bell of Sta. Croce, in the tall campanile over the cloisters which form part of the Villa d'Este, rang out a quarter to one. It was a bad bell, like most Italian bells, and I naturally alluded to the superiority of Belgium bells, above all others. Rather to my surprise, LISZT said, ""Yes, but how are they played? I remember being much struck by the Antwerp carillon."" I described to him the mechanism of the carillon clavegin and tambour, and reminded him that the Antwerp carillon was much out of tune, Bruges being superior, as well as of heavier calibre, and Mechlin bearing off the palm for general excellence. We stopped short on one of the terraces, and he seemed much interested with a description I gave him of a performance by the great carilloneur M. DENYN at Mechlin, and which reminded me of RUBINSTEIN at his best. He expressed surprise when I alluded to VAN DEN GHEYN'S compositions for bells, laid out like regular fugues and organ voluntaries, and equal in their way to BACH or HANDEL, who were contemporaries of the great Belgian organist and carilloneur. ""But,"" he said, ""the Dutch have also good bells. I was once staying with the King in Holland, arid I believe it was at Utrecht that I heard some bell-music which was quite wonderful.""

This is a Baptist chapel; the pastor was absent, and a young man, a student, filled his place. As a matter to be expected in such a case, there seemed to be some attempt at eloquence; we almost invariably see it in a young man, and especially in a student. It is often somewhat trying to listen to the sermons of the theological students, and so it was on this occasion. The hymns were given out by the Precentor, who read them badly enough, applying the same accent, or general inflection, to each stanza. Perhaps the following may convey some idea of his manner of reading:— Let the first line be commenced on a high pitch, and let the pitch rise by a slide gradually until a climax very high is obtained by a strong pressure tone and upward slide or inflection on the last syllable but two; then a sudden slide down, still on the same syllable, followed by still another upward on the last syllable, and this to be exactly the same in form, though differing a little in force in every couplet, or twice in each stanza:
How sweet the name of Jesus sounds&nbsp;In a believer’s ear;It soothes his sorrows, heals his wounds,And drives away his fear.
We have seldom heard a hymn read in a more mechanical sing-song manner, or in worse taste. There was no choir, and the congregation generally joined in the singing. The people were all seated in prayer, and all stood in singing. They all took their seats merely for the benediction after the last singing. People in our own country are very much troubled that the custom of sitting in prayer should be increasing so much; but it seems to prevail in a majority of the churches here.",1852-Ll-uuTLl:ll:ll,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/ace3303172e4b2810ebfa149bb7b1f74,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/ffac5b2cf19444e7e4ef663b6c21dd1e/1461670463145,Accompanied Indoor Public,http://musicbrainz.org/artist/f422b99a-b48c-4bee-bc0c-f2e8cad82b6c#_,Dr. Lowell Mason Lowell Mason,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hymn

Mr. Havergal rector. The exercises commenced by a few measures as a voluntary, or rather prelude, and the “giving out” the tune on the organ, after which all the congregation united in a single stanza sung to the old tune called “Tallis’s Evening Hymn.” The hymn was not read nor named, but it appeared to be a common thing for the worship to commence in the use of a stanza well known, always the same, and to the same tune. It was a hearty commencement, for every one seemed to join with full voice. The service was read by the curate. The chanting was done by the whole congregation, and the responding was between the occupants of the lower floor and those of the gallery — but the song was universal — men, women and children uniting harmonious voices. The Venite and the Te Deum were chanted responsively; the psalms were not chanted but, read in the usual manner. Two metrical hymns were sung during the service. The tunes were both of the old ecclesiastical class, and were in the same rhythmic form as St. Ann’s, York, &amp;c. appear in the Cantica Laudis. The first and last words of each line being long, and all the rest short. They were sung by all the people, and in very quick time; as fast as propriety would allow the enunciation of the words. They were sung somewhat quicker than the writer has taught this class of tunes in musical conventions and singing classes in America. Let the tune Uxbridge, for example, be sung in quick time, somewhat quicker than usual, and the crotchets will give the time of the minims in the above-named class of tunes. There were one or two organ interludes introduced in a psalm of five stanzas; but these were very short, not more than about two measures, or the length of the last line of a common metre tune. “These tunes would be popular in America,” said the lady who was with me, who, though not a singer, has been accustomed for many years to give close attention to the Psalmody, and to hear criticisms and remarks concerning it. And indeed, they are as far from being dull and heavy as need be; I doubt not that many good people, with us, would think it almost irreverent to sing a hymn through with such rapidity. Yet all the people, old and young, joined — all seemed to know the tunes perfectly, and all kept well together.",1852-01-Ee,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/7ef35b1367787b9f4ad76be481de577d,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/ce80fb5bd528186c2a47b5a8895e67cb/1448038083322,Accompanied Indoor Public,http://musicbrainz.org/artist/f422b99a-b48c-4bee-bc0c-f2e8cad82b6c#_,Dr. Lowell Mason Lowell Mason,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Male_vocals http://dbpedia.org/resource/Choir http://dbpedia.org/resource/Female_vocals,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hymn

By the kindness of an old and valued friend, and accomplished amateur, Herr Martin Herz, I was speedily introduced to most of the organists and composers of note in the town. The first organ I heard was at the church of S. Michael, celebrated for its great size and the height of its steeple. Herr Osterhault is the organist. 
[...]
The variety, character, and pungency of tone in the flue work, is as admirable as their reeds and swell organs are poor and defective. The pedal organ, containing seventeen stops, possesses a power and individuality of tone rarely equalled ; indeed I heard no finer in the whole of North Germany.
[...]
The organist spared neither time nor trouble in exhibiting the qualities of an instrument of which he was justly proud. In a dignified performance of a fine fugue, the full power of its grand tones permeated the whole church, but the touch and mechanical arrangements I found from my own playing to be cumbersome and ancient. It is unnecessary to describe the organs in the other churches in Hamburg, as they are similar in character to that at S. Michael’s ; they all, however, possess a stop called “ Glockenspiel,” which is a set of bells from tenor F upwards, the largest being about 6in. in diameter, the smallest about 1 in. These are struck with wood hammers, similar to those in a pianoforte, and, when used in conjunction with light 16ft. and 2ft. registers, produce for certain things-very pleasing effects.

In the spring of the following year (1872) Max obtained a letter of introduction to Joseph Joachim. An appointment was made, and one morning we found ourselves in the presence of the “king of violinists"" at the house of his late brother, Henry Joachim, with whom he always resided when staying in London. I do not know which of us was the more nervous. Max or myself (I was there as his accompanist); but I do know that he utterly failed to do himself justice. After he had played a page or two of one of Rode's concertos, Herr Joachim stopped him and asked whether he intended making “fiddling” his profession. “Yes,"" meekly replied my brother. “Well, in that case,"" continued the great man, in not unkindly tones, “I don't think you need play to me any more for the present. You have still a great deal to do, apart from learning how to hold your violin properly, and how to keep your elbow to your side when you draw your bow across the strings. But you have talent. When you have studied hard for another year or two, I shall be glad to hear you play again.” After which, he came to see us out at the front door, and we left the house in a not altogether enviable frame of mind. Of myself he barely took any notice; but six years later we were destined to meet under more favorable circumstances, and to begin a friendship which, I am proud to say, has endured without break down to the present time.

I found him a plain intelligent man, speaking very good English. I could suppose in person he somewhat resembles his great master, Haydn. He laid before me the oratorio of David, just composed by him, which I heard the following day. The choruses are magnificent, but so loaded with the brazen sounds, that they require at least fifty additional stringed instruments to a part, to counterbalance and assuage their terrible roar. There was also an enormous bass instrument, the Ophicleide, procured from Germany. It appeared like a column of brass towering in the band, and required a pair of Stentorian lungs to play upon it. Its lower tones were distinctly heard growling below all the other instruments. The author had, no doubt, preconceived the clamorous effect of a Jewish orchestra, to which the sackbut, shawn, and timbrel imparted a barbaric character. However learned and scientific this work may be, I was more gratified with what little I heard of his 'Mount Sinai.' "" The manner in which the Commandments are delivered at intervals from the holy mountain, in the tones of the ancient ecclesiastical canto fermo, accompanied by the sounds of the brazen instruments, is full of awful grandeur.""

'The music was very fine — ' the Creation,'—Spohr's ' Fall of Babylon' (a musical drama, called oratorio) —and 'Samson.' The text of the latter had been modified by Mr. Edward Taylor, so as to coincide with and comprehend that of Milton almost entirely, incorporating the newly-introduced portions by interspersing other Handelian passages, selected from his forgotten works, whether operas, or small and little noticed oratorios. According to Mr. Taylor, Handel had adopted a movement from Palestrina, and worked out a passage of ' Samson ' upon that guiding-thread : this suggested and gave occasion for the introduction of a hymn, founded upon an inexpressibly fine conception of Palestrina's. Nobody was aware of this, and all declared it to be the most striking part; the Bishop caused it to be repeated, and the whole assembly (above 2,000 in number) rose and remained standing, as during devotional pieces. After this piece, the greatest effect was produced by a short chorus, which no one had heard before : and that was, equally from the Septime, borrowed from Carissimo. This system of intercalation is in itself indefensible : but I must confess that the text, as it is, has a fine effect : the action progresses dramatically, and nothing could be easier than to make a representation with entire dramatic effect of this ' Samson' : an idea for which I sought to obtain acceptance.'",1842-09-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Norwich,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/http://data.open.ac.uk/led/music/Samson/1386008179538/1434011710919,Accompanied Indoor,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Lady+Williams/1434011428422 http://dbpedia.org/resource/Christian_Charles_Josias_von_Bunsen http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Lord+Northampton/1434011412831 http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Mrs+Baring/1434011460627 http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Miss+Trotter/1434011441952,"Lady Williams Christian Charles Josias, Baron von Bunsen Baron von Bunsen Christian Karl Josias von Bunsen Christian Charles Josias von Bunsen Lord Northampton Mrs Baring Miss Trotter",Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oratorio http://dbpedia.org/resource/Religious_music http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vocal_music http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chorale

The recitatives, songs, and concerted pieces were all given by pupils, and both these and the choruses were highly creditable to the institution. It was not a public performance, and was without rehearsal. Mr. Hauser was so kind as to allow us to choose what Oratorio should be sung, mentioning Elijah, St. Paul, the Creation, Seasons, and others; we chose Elijah, and it was put down before the choir accordingly, and, by them, quite satisfactorily rendered. It was a drilling, or training exercise, and the Director did not hesitate to stop the song whenever anything appeared to him to require it. Solo singers were in several instances stopped and corrected. The Director has full authority, and fears not to use it. After the performance was over, we spoke to him of the great advantage he had over an American Conductor in this respect; for surely no choir with which we are acquainted, would bear such close bringing up to the mark of perfection; and we said to him, that were he in America, and thus corrected faults, especially in a solo singer, the vocalist would very probably take his hat, bid him “good evening,” and be off.

It was at a popular chapel attached to a large establishment where poor children are cared for and protected, and which is much visited by strangers coming to London. Here the organ-playing is frivolous, light and trifling, we had almost said, as is Jullien's Quadrille Orchestra in Drury Lane. It is amazing that any one who has musical knowledge should so pervert the powers of his instrument. But yet the&nbsp;organist has fine powers of execution; he plays with a rapidity of finger, with a clean piano-forte touch, producing the staccato with as much distinctness as stringed instruments, and at times&nbsp;almost the pizzicato. So it was on the occasion when we last heard him, when the song, ""Why do the nations,"" from the Messiah, with the chorus, ""Let us break their bands,"" were sung to an organ accompaniment as brilliant almost as that of a grand orchestra.&nbsp;

On his return to town in the evening, he attended a reception given in his honor at the Grosvenor Gallery by Walter Bache. This was in some respects the most striking function of the series. The gathering was in every sense a representative one, and the famous abbe, as he went round chatting from group to group, seemed positively radiant with happiness. To repeat his own words, addressed to myself: “You have so overwhelmed me with kindness in this country that I shall be quite sorry when the time comes for me to leave you.” The programme comprised his “Angelus” for strings, a chorus for female voices, a pianoforte piece, and some songs; and finally, amid a scene of great excitement, he himself played the finale of Schubert's “Divertissement a la Hongroise” and his own Hungarian rhapsody in A minor. This glorious treat furnished the crowning feature of a memorable evening— doubly memorable because it was the last time but one that Franz Liszt touched his instrument in the presence of a public or quasi-public assemblage.",http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/day/1886-04-08,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/8846cca4a0345e0b412424b32ec881c4,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/b6d380bc0db92c89390b83acaa4da47f/1438263527623,Accompanied Indoor Domestic,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Hermann+Klein/1438157240872,Hermann Klein,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Piano,

He had called early, he said, in order to make me acquainted with the services at the Hofkirche, where he presides as court organist. I repaired at the appointed time to the church, which unequal, however, to most of our cathedrals, has a noble exterior and a very fine tower. It stands in a prominent and beautiful position near the bridge which crosses the Elbe. Here High Mass is celebrated every Sunday at eleven o’clock, and other services, such as are usual at Roman Catholic churches, follow during the day.&nbsp;The service on this occasion was most imposing, the large orchestra in the great West Gallery being occupied by about sixty performers (band and chorus), and the large organ, one of Silbermann’s best instruments, of which I intend to give a description in my next letter. Crowds of people were pressing on, and it was with some difficulty that I gained an entrance, and obtained access to Herr Merkel’s organ pew. The music consisted of a Mass in F minor, by the conductor, Herr Carl Krebs; an Offertorium, by Rastrelli ; and a Graduale, by Reissiger. With such a force of practical musicians, need I say that the music was given with thrilling power and effect ? and I have no doubt that those who were below, in the body of the church, heard the inspiring strains to much greater advantage than I who was seated amongst the performers. At the conclusion of High Mass nearly all the immense con­gregation, as well as the members of the orchestra, departed, and there followed a short service, the musical part of which was sustained by about a dozen singing boys and singing men, with organ accompaniment only. I had now an opportunity of listening to the organ, and was struck with its rich, full tone. As, however, Herr Merkel’s playing was limited to the require­ments of the service, he made an appointment with me for the following Tuesday, at ten o’clock, in order that we might hear the instrument alone and undisturbed.",187u-Mm-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dresden,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/ce50ceaa35075e06eb7160b8d8620128/1470137529381,Public Accompanied Indoor,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Dr+William+Spark/1465384918944,Dr William Spark,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_music

The denomination of stanze or saloons, is applied to an establishment formed by the middle ranks of the city, in opposition to the cazina of the nobility; the latter, indeed, only comprises a small number of the community, and the nobles frequently abandon it for the stanze of the citizens, where more freedom and gaiety reign than in their own circle, over which, it is said, the pretensions of etiquette throw a coldness and constraint; the founders of the stanze bear all the expense, and admit such persons as are presented to them; here, for conversation, there are various rooms, which are filled with good company; here are news-rooms, billiard-rooms, ball-rooms, and also a garden; in short, nothing is wanting to render the place agreeable; the evening flies in circle of varied and decent amusements; the building communicates with one of the theatres, so you may walk thither under the arcade and hear a song, return and eat an ice, join in conversation, or figure in a dance.",17Ll-uu-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Florence,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/43666bce0ba9aa60e9d92b86b7f39ed1/1517908072792,Indoor Accompanied Public,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Antoine+Laurent+Castellan/1517842957331,Antoine-Laurent Castellan,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice,

The choir in Mr. James’ church did not seem to be much in advance of the people in the manner of their performance; they tried to help the organ to lead, but no choir piece, either tune or anthem, was attempted by them. There was no chanting, as there is in many of the London churches, and metrical psalmody was the only form of song. Extempore parts were sung near to me, and especially by a gentleman who knew enough of music to sing always a third below the treble; this knowledge he took care to bring into practical use, and so, of course, was often producing fifths as much at variance with music’s laws as are nouns in the plural in connection with verbs in the singular number with the requirements of grammar. The first tune was St. Ann’s, with the good old-fashioned cadence on the mediant at the end of the third line—grand and effective; the second was St. Paul’s; the third we did not know, but while it was a pretty, “all's well"" kind of tune, it was unfit for Congregational singing, and an affected, fainting away, or “oh dear” result was the consequence.

It was necessary, however, in spite of the great success of the ""Tempesta,"" to provide employment for the other artists of the establishment, and to give some repose to those whose powers had been so long and so arduously taxed. The first change was made by the revival of the ""Montecchi e Capuletti"" of Bellini, for Madame Frezzolini as Giulietta, and Mademoiselle Parodi as Borneo. So many years had passed since Bellini's version of ""Romeo and Juliet"" had appeared on the boards of Her Majesty's Theatre, that it was received with a certain amount of curiosity, not to say as a novelty. Pleasing as are Bellini's, melodies throughout this opera, its disjointed and unsatisfactory libretto had always caused it to fail of securing a hearty welcome in a theatre where Shakspeare was involuntarily more or less in men's thoughts. But the combined attraction of Frezzolini and Parodi, both of whom were admirably ""suited"" in this opera, carried it through with very considerable eclat. The same occasion was used for the reappearance of Gardoni (the fourth successful primo tenore in my abundant list for the season), in the somewhat unsatisfactory part of Tebaldo; when this popular favourite was welcomed back with more than usual cordiality. Some of the enthusiasm demonstrated upon this occasion was due to a false report which had been spread about and had appeared in the public prints, respecting the death of this accomplished young tenor at St. Petersburg, where he had a winter engagement. The intelligence had been frequently given as authentic, although Gardoni had never had a moment's illness.",1850-uu-uu,,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/198cf36a7f2e69894954fad1c3c785f8/1438783011044,Indoor Public Accompanied,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Benjamin+Lumley/1438607277398,Benjamin Lumley,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

The mixture was healthy and prepared our people for the greater things yet to come. Finally the red-letter day dawned which brought me a degree of happiness that I shall never forget Max Maretzek had an opera troupe in the Federal Street Theatre. He brought out Mozart’s Don Giovanni, with the fine singer Bosio as “Zerlini.” Perhaps my pleasure was heightened by the fact that the director used my score. The copy is one of the earliest published, with the German title-page, Don Juan; or, The Stone Ghost; a Comic Opera in Two Acts.

Since Easter, the Motets with Orchestra have been resumed; and to-day, the musical exercises were somewhat different from what they usually are. A Chorale was first sung; but there were not many people to join in. The exercises commence precisely at eight o’clock, whether anybody is there or not; and sometimes I have attended public worship, when there was no one present at the commencement, except the singers. After the chorale to-day, the first two movements of a mass by Cherubini were sung, “Kyrie,” and “Gloria in excelsis;"" sung, too, not in the vernacular language of the land, but in the original Greek and Latin. The “Kyrie &nbsp;commenced with a short Violoncello solo; this is followed by a vocal solo for a Bass voice; after which the other parts join. There is much solo throughout the movement. The music, although very fine, did not appear to me to be very supplicating in its character, nor did it seem to urge the cry for mercy as one might suppose David urged it in the fifty-first psalm. At the close of the “Kyrie,” the minister, at the altar, chanted a few words of prayer, and then followed a brilliant “Gloria in excelsis,” mostly in chorus. A fugue is introduced, and the closing movement, to the word Amen, is very animating and triumphant. At the close of the “Gloria,” the minister chanted the collect for the day with response by the choir; afterwards followed prayer, and then came a very fine Motet or Hymn with Orchestra, composed by Spohr. The moment this closed, choir and orchestra scattered, and were seen no more. The organ instantly announced a chorale, and the loud congregational chorus arose, most cheering, most refreshing, Sabbath-like, a song of worship, solemn, grand, majestic, “fit for an angel to play, or a martyr to hear;"" raising one’s feelings, and bringing home thoughts of God, heaven, holiness, redemption, and eternity.",1852-04-Ee,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/5f1fc11e8124c7de007bbab57e4fb697,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/fee28a944fadf4279813afc539bf4d35/1448316389885,Indoor Accompanied Public,http://musicbrainz.org/artist/f422b99a-b48c-4bee-bc0c-f2e8cad82b6c#_,Dr. Lowell Mason Lowell Mason,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Choir http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_music

The congregation was small, and was (as we supposed from the application of almost every one who came in to the Beadleship for a seat) composed mostly of strangers. The service was dull and monotonous, no one appearing to manifest any other interest than a desire to get through. The chanting, however, was an exception, and was of a character somewhat new. It was almost exclusively instrumental, being performed on the organ. Of course, we could find no fault with the articulation of words, or the rapidity of utterance, since the pipes appeared to do their best. But voices could not be heard in this part of the service with the exception of “Gloria Patri,” in which there was a feeble attempt at vocal effect. It may be well for congregations who do not wish to be at the trouble of opening their mouths and speaking forth God’s praises in the “Venite,” “Jubilate Deo,” and other canticles, to confide the matter wholly to a faithful instrument; for, under a master’s hand, it is always sure.",1852-09-Ee,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/67819eec730342e5a7cbb6aa92af696e,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/23a88d1d3bf2e061b042c51ee518bc2a/1448921047722,Indoor Public Accompanied,http://musicbrainz.org/artist/f422b99a-b48c-4bee-bc0c-f2e8cad82b6c#_,Dr. Lowell Mason Lowell Mason,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pipe_organ http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_music

At this, and the associate churches, the old psalms of Clement, Marot, and Theodore Beza, with the tunes originally set to them, are still sung.

We also gave for many seasons the so-called popular Saturday night concerts; for which we secured other artists to play septettes, octettes, and nonettes of mixed wind and string instruments. Nearly every pianist of distinction played repeatedly with us; among them were Mr. William Scharfenberg, Otto Dresel, Ernst Perabo, J. C. D. Parker, B. J. Lang, Hugo Leonard, Gustav Satter, J. Trenkle, John L. Hatton, and Miss Fay (now Mrs. Sherwood).

On Saturday, May the 20th, Madame Tadolini, the favourite heroine of Donizetti, whose great reputation in all the chief theatres of Italy, as well as at Vienna, had rendered her debut a matter of much surmise and curiosity, made her first appearance in ""Linda di Chamouni."" That this debut was successful could not be gainsaid. With a fine person, a voice of excellent natural quality, considerable brilliancy of execution (slightly defective perhaps in finish), and energetic powers as an actress, the new prima donna displayed much to justify the warmth of her welcome, and the amount of encouraging applause which followed upon it. Still, the impression made by this great favourite of so many continental audiences was neither strong nor permanent; so hard was it to struggle with advantage against the absorbing prestige which surrounded Jenny Lind.",http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/day/1848-05-20,,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/e175b188bc7e1fdad28c6dd6b59a839c/1438767036933,Accompanied Public Indoor,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Benjamin+Lumley/1438607277398,Benjamin Lumley,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

It had, for those days, quite a sizable orchestra. The leader sat facing the stage, and was for a long time the only first violin. We had but one second violin, one viola, one contrabass, no violoncello, one flute, two clarinets, one fagott, two horns, a trumpet, a trombone, and drums. The kind and quality of music played would nowadays strike one as queer. It consisted of overtures, quadrilles, polkas, galops—in short, mostly dance music. There was a total absence of so-called popular music, if we except a few quicksteps and marches. There were no characteristic pieces such as figure on the programmes of today.
I well remember the first one we were asked to play. It was called the Matrimonial Galop. It was of ordinary construction, the only reason for its peculiar name being a sudden hold-up, where the drummer or leader, I forget which, blew into a little instrument that gave out a sound like the cry of a baby. That childish noise made the audience roar with delight, and we had to play it nightly. We poor musicians suffered ; but one night we had our revenge. The usual calls came from the audience—they wanted the baby-cry, but did not get it. &nbsp;The machine crying-baby had vanished— it could not be found. Consternation reigned among those who wanted the people pleased, no matter how it was done. We tried to appease the audience by playing the galop; but when we came to the spot of spots, and there was no realistic baby-cry, but only a base imitation made on the fiddle, a howl of derision and rage went up, equal to anything ever heard in a menagerie. The disappointment was more than the audience could stand.",184u-uu-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boston,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/ab1bfe9cfe9d0a7a5f83197f5ca89828/1449564475544,Indoor Public Accompanied,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Thomas+Ryan/1448997315048,Thomas Ryan,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Violin http://dbpedia.org/resource/Viola http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trumpet http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horn_(instrument) http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cello http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flute http://dbpedia.org/resource/Drum http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trombone http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clarinet,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dance_music

The ""Lombardi"" of Verdi, never a very popular opera in England, was revived for the first appearance of a new tenor. The public had been so greatly disappointed for some time past in the ""great"" tenors who had lately appeared (though lavishly decked with Italian laurels), that but little sensation was created by the announcement of the debut of "" again a new tenor "" in Signor Baucarde. On the contrary, an expectation of fresh disappointment hung over the minds of all. Under these circumstances, Baucarde may be said to have taken the town by surprise. According to a current story, young Baucarde had been originally employed in the palace kitchen of the Grand Duke of Tuscany; and, like the celebrated composer Lully, he first attracted the attention of his superiors by his talents for cookery. His manifest vocal advantages caused him to be placed in a position to acquire a sound musical education, and thus to become one of the most agreeable tenors of his time. Nothing was expected, yet great results were achieved. With a charmingly sweet, bnt still robust voice of wonderful extension; with a style wherein the use of the falsetto was at once sparingly and judiciously employed, this young artist won easily upon a public accustomed to give a preference to natural gifts over the display of skill. Not that Baucarde was deficient in skill; on the contrary, his ""school"" was excellent. As an actor he rose scarcely above mediocrity, but any deficiency in this respect was overlooked in the splendour of his ""organ.""

Mr. Binney’s church, Fish Street Hill, Weigh House Chapel. Mr. Binney was in America a few years since, and is well known to many persons there. He is not only an excellent preacher; but, although not a musician, he is a lover of music, and has done much to promote psalmody among his own people. The order of the service in his church is most beautiful; I hardly know that it could be improved; it is as follows:
&nbsp;
I. Invocation. The Lord’s Prayer alone was used the Sabbath we were there.
II. Hymn.
III. Reading first lesson from Scriptures.
IV. Prayer — half as long as the long prayer in American churches.
V. Psalm, chanted.
VI. Reading second lesson from Scriptures — New Testament.
VII. Prayer, about the length of former.
VIII. Hymn.
IX. Sermon.
Anthem, a hymn.
XI. Very short prayer, and benediction.
&nbsp;
There is no choir; the singing is congregational, and led by a precentor. It was quite good; one does not often hear a better performance of this part of the public worship, but yet it would be much improved if simple tunes, appropriate to Congregational singing, were substituted for the too difficult ones attempted on the Sabbath we were present. A peculiarity of the singing here, is, that the whole congregation engage in chanting. The 24th Psalm was chanted to one of the plain old English chants, with an effect far, very far better than one hears when he listens to the trained Cathedral choirs. [...] Mr. Binney’s sermon, on Christian growth and development, was most able and satisfactory.

He tries to earn money as a travelling bookseller]
[W]ere kept there [Perth] a few days by some old aquaintances, started thence towards Methven, sold little on the way thither, but were kindly treated by the workers at Huntingtower and Cromwell Park. The people there were themselves on limited work—indeed, many of them had none; yet they shared their little substance with those that had less. It is always so; but for the poor, the poorer would perish.
Just before entering Methven, I sold a small book to a person breaking stones for the road. After some conversation, I discovered he was musical, and was strongly tempted to sell him my flute. He had taken a fancy to it, and offered a good price. I resisted; it had long been my companion, and sometimes my solace; and indeed, to speak truth, for some days past, attended to certain “forlorn hope” whisperings, implying the possible necessity of using the instrument in a way more to be lamented than admired. […] The demand for our lodging-money [at Methven] was decided, and so was I. I took my woe-warn partner [wife] aside, whispered her to pick my flute from out our “budgets,” put on her mantle, and follow me. As we went along I disclosed my purpose of playing in the outskirts of the village.
[…]
&nbsp;[W]e found ourselves in a beautiful green lane, fairly out of town, and opposite a genteel-looking house, at the windows of which sat several well-dressed people.
[…]
The sun had been down a good while, and the gloamin’ [sunset afterglow] was lovely. In spite of everything, I felt a momentary reprieve. I dipped my dry flute in a little burn [stream], and began to play. It rang sweetly amongst the trees. I moved on and on, still playing, and still facing the town. “The flowers of the forest” brought me before the house lately mentioned. My music raised one window after another, and in less than ten minutes put me in possession of 3s 9d of good British money. […] I had also a turn for strathspeys [a type of dance tune] and there appeared to be a run on them. By this time I was nearing the middle of the town. When I finally made my way, and retired to my lodging, it was with five shillings and some pence, in addition to what was given us.",183u-Ll-uu,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/44a9cafa64e3718a31f75634f44c7256,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/316423f5edd3c198383b48e270587f6d/1524245155358,Indoor Domestic Accompanied,,,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flute,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/musicgenre/traditional+song

Surely none who heard that magnificent performance of the Manzoni “Requiem"" can have ever forgotten the combined effect of the beautiful music, the superb singing of the Albert Hall choir (trained by Barnby), the wonderful voices of the soloists, and, pervading all, the subtle magnetic influence induced by the presence and personal guidance of the composer. The solo artists included three members of the original quartet, namely: Mme. Stolz, Mme. Waldmann, and Signor Masini. All possessed noble organs ; and the famous tenor, who has never been heard in opera in England, was then quite at his best. But the undoubted gem of the whole performance was the “Agnus Dei”, with its octave unison phrases for the two women's voices, sung by Stolz and Waldmann with a delicacy and charm of simply ethereal loveliness. Nor shall I forget the pains taken by Verdi at rehearsal to obtain from his chorus and orchestra of eight hundred a pianissimo in fitting proportion to the exquisite tone of these singers.

We had been down to the Prater one afternoon where we had come across a band of gipsy musicians, and the desperate melancholy, the capricious gaiety, and utterly reckless joy of the music had gone to my head like strong wine. I felt I wanted to kick over the traces and do something to make the combined hair of the Universe stand straight on end ! Instead of doing that, I began to cry ! I don’t know what possessed me, but I suppose that, after the hours and hours that I had forced myself to work at counterpoint with its cut and dried rules, the lawless, devil-me-care vitality of that gipsy music woke up something in me that has never gone to sleep again, something that will live as long as I have breath, something that made me feel as if my heart and the heart of all humanity had been laid bare to me for a moment, so that I might understand, once and for all, the heights and depths of emotion at white heat, the heights and depths of joy, grief, love - fierce, passionate, demanding all, and giving all magnificently, counting no costs - hate, jealousy, the ecstasy of liberty, the sheer delight in tremendous spaces, vast horizons, the immediate response to the imperious impulse of the moment, whether for good or evil, so that I might understand, in a word, the human heart let loose like a horse on the wild Hungarian puszta, with no guiding light beyond the flaming torch of its own passions - the human heart to whom religion has never made its noble, its equally passionate, but superbly unselfish, appeal !",188u-Ee-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prater,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/76d643458accce0aee6fb985ce276cdb/1476600768904,Accompanied Public,http://musicbrainz.org/artist/eca4d562-1e5c-409a-89fa-5489d102cdcb#_,Maude V.

The concert room is not large, but convenient, and good for musical effect. The centre of the room is occupied by ladies, and the outer seats mostly by gentlemen. A narrow gallery, in which are a number of private boxes, runs round the room. The first object of attraction, after entering the room, is a fine large medallion of Mendelssohn, back of the orchestra; there is no other bust or picture in the room. It makes one feel sod when looking at this fine representation of the great modem composer, in the very room where he has been, and still is, so highly appreciated, and where he has so often triumphed gloriously, to think that he was cut off in his youth, and that the musical world, after so short a time of enjoyment, was deprived of the talents and learning of one who promised to do for music, perhaps, more than any man living. At almost every concert, more or less of his music is performed; his memory is cherished, not only here, where he was so well known, but by all the musical world, and his name shall be held in everlasting remembrance.
A crowd of people were waiting round the door, when we arrived; and, although it was an hour before the time for the performance to commence, the room was filled, (save the reserved seats in the gallery,) in a few minutes after the door was opened. One must be on hand at an early hour to get a good seat. In about half an hour the members of the orchestra began to make their appearance, and as all the people in the house were talking loud, so the musicians, as they came in, one after another, began to tune, to try their instruments, and to amuse themselves by running over the scales; so that by the time they were all there, thus employed, the room was filled with sound; the more so because, as the musicians began to exercise themselves upon their instruments, the talking and laughing grew louder and louder, and at a quarter of an hour before the commencement of the music, it was a perfect Babel in the concert room, and as difficult to hear one speak as it is in a railroad car, with all the windows open, in summer. But a few minutes before the hour, the room began to grow quiet, musical expectation began to awaken, and when, as the precise moment arrived, the conductor’s signal was heard, everything was still, and perfect silence took the place of noise and confusion. Another signal, and the whole band, as one man, were heard interpreting and presenting to a most attentive audience, one of the great works of the immortal Beethoven.
It was the Sinfonie No. 8, F major. This is not regarded as one of Beethoven’s greatest triumphs; but, although it is light and playful, it abounds in each of its four movements, with the most fanciful and imaginative melodic figures, contrapuntal points, and instrumental contrasts. Ever lively and ever new, it never tires, but holds one in a kind of musical ecstasy from beginning to end; there seems to be no place where one can relax attention, or cease to be filled with musical delight; so that at the close of each part, a good long breath naturally comes in as a relief; and one becomes conscious of the intensity of the application he has been giving to the discourse.
The very first thing which strikes one, on hearing such an orchestra as this, is the perfect oneness of the violins. They do, indeed, constitute a perfect chorus — ten or more persons are playing the first violin, and as many more the second; but they are all artists, and, therefore, each one loses himself; no one is heard above the others; but all so beautifully blend as to constitute one perfect whole. This is the perfection of a chorus, be it vocal or instrumental; and this effect is produced by the Gewandhaus Orchestra.
Another point, immediately noticed, is the proper proportion of wind and stringed instruments; but perhaps the most striking point, as contrasted with our American orchestras, is the perfection of the wind instruments. It is too often the case in our orchestras that some wind instrument is wanting; thus the oboe or the faggotto is often missing; and again, it is not unfrequently the case that, although there may be some one to hold these or other instruments in the hand, or up to the sight of the audience, a tone is seldom permitted to escape from them; they are seen but not heard, Not so here; every instrument is not only represented to the eye, but is in the hands of a master who makes it speak to the ear. The consequence is, that such combinations fall upon the ear as are not heard with us. The brass instruments too are made to tell their story without any impediment of speech; whereas, with us, they stutter, or falter, or hem, or cough, to the no small disturbance of the equilibrium of one’s temper. We do not know that in this concert every instrument is played in all respects right; we do not know but some notes may have been omitted, or wrong tones produced, but certain are we that we did not discover any such imperfections. There are four things, (technical points,) that we have seldom heard well exhibited elsewhere, which were exceedingly well brought out here, viz.: Piano, Crescendo, Diminuendo and Fortzando. These, with the other technicals of playing were so well observed, that added to the pure tone peculiar to each particular instrument, and connected with a most perfect amalgamation or blending of all the different elements of the orchestra, they seemed to produce, not a mere musical performance to be listened to, but a living being, or moral, spiritual existence, capable of expressing the deepest feeling, and of calling forth the strongest sympathies of humanity.
The Sinfonie being over, and a few moments for rest having been given, old Handel visited us in an Arie from his Opera “Aerio” — “Folle e colui che al tuo favor si fida.” It was sung by Herrn Salvatore Marchesi, who was the only vocalist for the evening. The song was well sung; but we sometimes hear quite as good singing across the Atlantic. Belletti is decidedly his superior. The third piece was a Flute Concerto; it was a tiresome affair. A Flute Concerto is a Flute Concerto, whether in the Gewandhaus, Hanover Square rooms, Tripler Hall or the Melodeon; and although it may not be always played by Herrn W. Haake, (who certainly did his duty well,) it is always the most dry and uninteresting of musical performances.
In part 2d was given, 1st, the beautiful overture Echoes of Ossian, (often played in New York and Boston,) by N. W. Gade. 2d. Arie from Zauberflote, by Mozart, “Qui sdegno non s' accende."" 3d. Mendelssohn’s concerto for the piano forte, in D. Minor. 4th. Arie from Don Giovanni, by Mozart, “Madamina, il catalogo e questo,"" and 5th. The very fine overture to the opera, “Der Wassertrager,” by Cherubini.
Gade’s overture may be regarded as a sacred piece. It speaks of greatness, and calls forth emotions of the sublime. Something like an Old Chorale pervades the whole, which seems to tell of worship, and to call forth humble adoration. With what grandeur this subject was given out, and oft in the course of the piece alluded to by the brass instruments, or exemplified and illustrated by the others, cannot be told. The overture is known with us, but it requires and deserves dose study.
The Piano Forte Concerto, D (not G) Minor, failed for want of a performer; a highly promising young lad of the conservatory attempted it, but he had neither grasp of mind nor of hand enough for Mendelssohn. Herr Marchesi sang both airs well, gaining for himself decided applause.
On the whole, here is a highly-talented and well-regulated orchestra. The conductor for the evening was Julius Rietz, well known to the musical world.
I will mention one or two things about the audience:
1st. Gentlemen took off their hats before passing the door of the hall, all of them, without a single exception; and this, although they were there an hour before the performance commenced. There was not a single man standing under the galleries or near the doors, uncovered. The ungentlemanly act of standing or sitting in a concert room with hats on, could not be seen in the Gewandhaus.
2d. Ladies were all in full dress.
3d. There was silence during the performance of music. The moment the music ceased, then indeed there was a perfect buzzing of voices, and very loud talking all over the room; but at the signal for the commencement of the music, all was still; and we were not prevented from hearing the music by those whisperings, so annoying in some places.
On the whole, this was a very fine concert; the orchestra playing was as near to perfection, I doubt not, as can often be found; and that constitutes the great attraction of the Gewandhaus. Every man seems to be able to play on his own instrument well; every man seems to give undivided attention to the music, and to endeavor to observe carefully, not only the time, as given by the conductor, but all those little gesticulations by which expression is indicated.

Such morning concerts are quite common in the larger German cities. An individual, having the means to do it, employs at his own expense an orchestra, or more probably a quartet, or quintet, makes out his own programme, and invites his friends to spend a couple of hours in listening to fine music. On the present occasion, an audience of perhaps two hundred persons (the most musical people of Frankfort) were brought together. Schindler, the biographer of Beethoven, Schmidt the pianist, and other distinguished persons, were present. The concert consisted of both vocal and instrumental music; and Music’s sister, Elocution, was also brought in, and lent her aid in the exercises of the occasion. The programme contained the following pieces (though not in the order in which they are here put down), viz.:— &nbsp;Quintet (G. minor), Mozart, charmingly — I suppose it may be, said, perfectly played by Messrs. Wolff, Baldenecker, Posch, Drinnenberg, and Siedentopf. Quintet Movement, Mozart. This very beautiful movement by Mozart has not before been played since the year 1783. It has been recently discovered in Mozart’s own hand-writing, among his manuscripts, which for some twenty years have been in the family of André of Offenbach. It will shortly be published. Recitative and Air, with violoncello and obligato accompaniment, composed by John Sebastian Bach. This song is quite of a popular character, notwithstanding it is by Bach, reminding one somewhat of Handel’s most popular songs. It is a sacred song, from an unpublished cantate; but the Recitative and Song will soon be published. Part-Songs, for soprano, alto, tenor, and bass. Two songs were sung by a well-trained double quartet. A Poem on Mozart was well read by a lady, having a rich alto voice, Fraulein Gräemann. The effect of introducing this elocutionary exercise was very pleasing, and the example is a good one to be followed wherever a really excellent reader can be found to sustain the part. Strangers are sometimes invited to play in these concerts; and on the present occasion two pianoforte pieces, “Amitie pour amitie,” composed by the performer, and Doneyschock’s Rhapsodie in C. Minor, were played by Mr. William Mason of Boston, U. S.

The stalls, boxes, and pit were crowded with&nbsp;the elite of Viennese society, fashionable, artistic, and&nbsp;literary...fill[ing] all the ""numbered''&nbsp;seats at the Wieden...&nbsp;whilst the galleries were thronged almost to suffocation by Strauss's most enthusiastic admirers — the true&nbsp;bom Viennese of the lower middle classes. Archduke&nbsp;William — who, being Grand Master of the Order of St.&nbsp;John, seldom shows himself in a theatre — occupied the&nbsp;Imperial Box, whilst King Milan of Servia sate out the&nbsp;whole performance in a ground-tier stage box, signifying&nbsp;his admiration for the bénéficiaire's talents and achievements by conferring upon him, towards the close of the&nbsp;evening, the Cross of the Takovo Order. The progranmie of the occasion consisted of selections from&nbsp;Strauss's operas, conducted by himself. His desk was&nbsp;converted for the nonce into a gorgeous flower-bed of the&nbsp;costliest exotics; and his appearance thereat, baton in&nbsp;hand, was the signal for a demonstration of affectionate&nbsp;rejoicing on the part of the audience, such as, according&nbsp;to the leading journals of the Kaiserstadt, has never&nbsp;before been witnessed within the walls of a Vienna&nbsp;theatre. He opened the entertainment with his bright&nbsp;little overture to Indigo — his first opera, produced at the&nbsp;Wieden Theatre about twenty years ago — which was&nbsp;rapturously re-demanded. Then came the first act of A&nbsp;Night in Venice, followed by the immortal Schoene blaue&nbsp;Donau during the entr'acte, which inimitable waltz&nbsp;brought down a shower of laurel wreaths upon its composer's head. The second act of Fledermaus with some&nbsp;additions to the dialogue written especially for the&nbsp;occasion, came next, and was succeeded by ""musical&nbsp;episodes "" from Spitzentuch, Methusalem, Cagliostro, Der Lustige Krieg and the Carnival in Rome,&nbsp;each successive&nbsp;number being supplemented by presentations of addresses,&nbsp;medals, and flowers.&nbsp;",http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/day/1884-10-15,,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/9b175abe9696208969061d62d82e3642/1451947243036,Indoor Public Accompanied,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Milian+I+of+Serbia/1451947039739 http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/William+Beatty-Kingston/1444079044346,Milian I of Serbia William Beatty-Kingston,Performance,,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_music

Sontag is gone, and the Gewandhaus Orchestra is thrown upon its own strength and resources; but it fails not, neither is it faint or weary. The Eighteenth Concert was (save the charming singer) one of the very best of the season. The Orchestra (said one who has often heard) never played better; well might they feel the inspiration of their author, for they played Beethoven's 4th Symphonic, than which he has not written a better. It is not so well known in America, but it cannot rank second to anything which Beethoven has composed.
The adagio (sextuple movement) is as perfect in design and as beautiful in coloring as in any work of musical art. Fraulein Anna Klassig sang a Recitative and Arie from Sphor's Jessonda. Herr G. Kruger, from Stuttgart, played two pieces well on the Harp; and a well-trained choir, Pauliner Sänger-Vereins, of fifty men’s voices sung three pieces, two of which were by Mendelssohn, and one of which may be found in the “Fireside Harmony” (Waserfahrt.) Mendelssohn’s Overture ""Melusine,"" as fine an Overture as exists, was played; and the performance was worthy of the composition.
These Concerts are very popular and fashionable. The Musical Professors are all there, expectation is fully awake, and I believe almost always fully gratified.

WHEWELL’S ability was of a truly cosmic and universal character, but nature had denied him one gift the gift of music. He always beat time in chapel, and generally sang atrociously out of tune. I do not think he had any ear; music to him was something marvellous and fascinating; he could talk learnedly on music, admire music, go to concerts, have music at his house, worry over it, insist upon silence when it was going on ; and yet I knew, and he knew that I knew, that he knew nothing about it; it was a closed world to him, a riddle, yet one he was incessantly bent upon solving, and he felt that I had the key to it and he had not. 
On that night I played ERNST'S ""Elegie,"" not quite so hackneyed then as it is now, and some other occasional pieces by ERNST, in which I gave the full rein to my fancy. The Master left his company, and taking a chair in front of where I stood, remained in absorbed meditation during the performance. I was naturally a little elated at this mark of respect shown to an unknown freshman in the presence of so many ""Heads"" of Houses and the elite of the University. I played my best and indulged rather freely in a few more or less illegitimate dodges, which I thought calculated to bewilder the great man. I was rewarded, for at the close DR. WHEWELL laid his hand upon my arm. ""Tell me one thing; how do you produce that rapid passage, ascending and descending notes of fixed intervals?"" I had simply as a tour de force glided my whole hand up and down the fourth open string, taking, of course, the complete series of harmonics up and down several times and producing thus the effect of a rapid cadenza with the utmost ease; the trick only requires a certain lightness of touch, and a knowledge of where and when to stop with effect. I replied that I had only used the series of open harmonics which are yielded, according to the well-known mathematical law, by every stretched string when the vibration is interrupted at the fixed harmonic nodes. The artistic application of a law which, perhaps, he had never realised but in theory seemed to delight him intensely, and he listened whilst I repeated the cadenza, and again and again showed him the various intervals on the finger-board, where the open harmonics might be made to speak; a hairVbreadth one way or the other producing a horrid scratch instead of the sweet, flute-like ring. It struck him as marvellous how a violinist could hit upon the various intervals to such a nicety, as to evoke the harmonic notes. I replied that this was easy enough when the hand was simply swept up and down the string as I had done, but that to hit upon the lesser nodes for single harmonics was one of the recognised violin difficulties. I then showed him a series of stopped harmonics, and played, much to his surprise, a tune in stopped harmonics. He was interested to hear that PAGANINI had been the first to introduce this practice, which has since become common property.",185u-uu-uu,,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/56de5aa322a9b2ddbfc307ea9b0c0f35/1437731060157,Accompanied Domestic Indoor,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/William+Whewell/1437731002725,William Whewell,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Violin,

Sontag, by marriage the Countess Rossi. The weather was unfavorable, being rainy, and the streets were muddy. I took my place at the door of the Gewandhaus at half-past four, where the people were then gathering. By five, when the outer door was opened, a multitude had assembled, and immediately rushed into the house, filling the long stairway and entry. Here was another interval of waiting, until half-past five, when the door of the hall was opened, and the room was immediately filled. We had now to wait another hour, or until half-past six; when the performance commenced with a Symphonie, by Joseph Hadyn in C, very light, playful, and pleasing, but lacking the depth of a Beethoven or a Mendelssohn. It is so easy a composition, that it seemed to be quite children’s play for the orchestra, who yet rendered it in the most perfect manner possible. This was followed by an Arie from “Rinaldo” by Handel; a most charming song indeed, and as charmingly sung by Mad. Sontag. Of Mad. Sontag’s singing, I dare not speak now. I will only say that no one can have a more perfect execution; but to say in what her excellence consists, as a singer, or what are the peculiarities of her style, must not now be attempted.
The third piece was “Romanze for the Violin,” by Beethoven; performed by Herr Concertmeister, Ferdinand David. This is the David whose compositions for the violin are so well known, and whose reputation as a player is so extensive. Mad. Sontag then sang ""Bel raggio lusinghier,"" from Rossini’s Semiramide, a song requiring the greatest powers of vocalization; this was perfectly given by the inimitable artist.
The second part consisted of the Overture and a long scene from Gluck’s famous “Iphigenie in Tauride;"" the principal vocal part being that of Iphigenie by Mad. Sontag. Gluck has not been heard with us, but he ranks in the very first class of composers here. The overture is a magnificent concert piece, and it was performed by this fine orchestra with wonderful precision and effect.

The meeting began with a chorale— 'Will the day break in the East ?

There is neither organ nor choir in Mr. Noel’s chapel. The singing is entirely Congregational, and is led by a precentor, who occupies a secondary pulpit in front of that of the minister, and who, in addition to his singing duties, reads the notices. He gives out the hymn, proclaiming its number, and also at the same time gives the name of the tune; then he reads a stanza which is immediately sung by all the people, and in like manner the succeeding stanzas are read and sung. It is not easy to see why the stanza is read before it is sung, since all the people have hymn-books, and many of them also tune books. The singing of the psalms was as good as may be expected where choir tunes are used for congregational purpose. The tunes here were altogether too difficult for the people’s use; difficult in rhythmics and difficult in melodics. The attempt too, to sing in parts, was not in all cases productive of the greatest good; for example: We stood by the side of a young man who was furnished with a tune book containing only the bass part. In the first tune we sung out the bass with as much voice as we could conveniently command, but with the second tune we were unacquainted, and could not therefore join in the exercise. This was observed by the young man, who drew near and held out his bass part, thus enabling us to sing. But he, while he was looking carefully first at his hymn book and then to his tune book, so as to be sure and be right, was, with his bass part before him, singing all the way the treble part, two octaves below the pitch! How a little knowledge may expose one’s ignorance!
The general effect of the singing was, notwithstanding these drawbacks, very good, vastly better than some of the attempts at musical display which we have witnessed in churches in England and on the Continent; and if it was not musically attractive, it was religiously edifying, and served to revive the affections and lift them upwards.
The standing position was observed in singing, and the sitting position in prayer. The people generally had Bibles, and often referred to the texts which the preacher quoted.",1852-08-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/London,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/23a88d1d3bf2e061b042c51ee518bc2a/1448397084730,Public Indoor Accompanied,http://musicbrainz.org/artist/f422b99a-b48c-4bee-bc0c-f2e8cad82b6c#_,Dr. Lowell Mason Lowell Mason,Performance,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/thing/congregation,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_music

The concert room is not large, but convenient, and good for musical effect. The centre of the room is occupied by ladies, and the outer seats mostly by gentlemen. A narrow gallery, in which are a number of private boxes, runs round the room. The first object of attraction, after entering the room, is a fine large medallion of Mendelssohn, back of the orchestra; there is no other bust or picture in the room. It makes one feel sod when looking at this fine representation of the great modem composer, in the very room where he has been, and still is, so highly appreciated, and where he has so often triumphed gloriously, to think that he was cut off in his youth, and that the musical world, after so short a time of enjoyment, was deprived of the talents and learning of one who promised to do for music, perhaps, more than any man living. At almost every concert, more or less of his music is performed; his memory is cherished, not only here, where he was so well known, but by all the musical world, and his name shall be held in everlasting remembrance.
A crowd of people were waiting round the door, when we arrived; and, although it was an hour before the time for the performance to commence, the room was filled, (save the reserved seats in the gallery,) in a few minutes after the door was opened. One must be on hand at an early hour to get a good seat. In about half an hour the members of the orchestra began to make their appearance, and as all the people in the house were talking loud, so the musicians, as they came in, one after another, began to tune, to try their instruments, and to amuse themselves by running over the scales; so that by the time they were all there, thus employed, the room was filled with sound; the more so because, as the musicians began to exercise themselves upon their instruments, the talking and laughing grew louder and louder, and at a quarter of an hour before the commencement of the music, it was a perfect Babel in the concert room, and as difficult to hear one speak as it is in a railroad car, with all the windows open, in summer. But a few minutes before the hour, the room began to grow quiet, musical expectation began to awaken, and when, as the precise moment arrived, the conductor’s signal was heard, everything was still, and perfect silence took the place of noise and confusion. Another signal, and the whole band, as one man, were heard interpreting and presenting to a most attentive audience, one of the great works of the immortal Beethoven.
It was the Sinfonie No. 8, F major. This is not regarded as one of Beethoven’s greatest triumphs; but, although it is light and playful, it abounds in each of its four movements, with the most fanciful and imaginative melodic figures, contrapuntal points, and instrumental contrasts. Ever lively and ever new, it never tires, but holds one in a kind of musical ecstasy from beginning to end; there seems to be no place where one can relax attention, or cease to be filled with musical delight; so that at the close of each part, a good long breath naturally comes in as a relief; and one becomes conscious of the intensity of the application he has been giving to the discourse.
The very first thing which strikes one, on hearing such an orchestra as this, is the perfect oneness of the violins. They do, indeed, constitute a perfect chorus — ten or more persons are playing the first violin, and as many more the second; but they are all artists, and, therefore, each one loses himself; no one is heard above the others; but all so beautifully blend as to constitute one perfect whole. This is the perfection of a chorus, be it vocal or instrumental; and this effect is produced by the Gewandhaus Orchestra.
Another point, immediately noticed, is the proper proportion of wind and stringed instruments; but perhaps the most striking point, as contrasted with our American orchestras, is the perfection of the wind instruments. It is too often the case in our orchestras that some wind instrument is wanting; thus the oboe or the faggotto is often missing; and again, it is not unfrequently the case that, although there may be some one to hold these or other instruments in the hand, or up to the sight of the audience, a tone is seldom permitted to escape from them; they are seen but not heard, Not so here; every instrument is not only represented to the eye, but is in the hands of a master who makes it speak to the ear. The consequence is, that such combinations fall upon the ear as are not heard with us. The brass instruments too are made to tell their story without any impediment of speech; whereas, with us, they stutter, or falter, or hem, or cough, to the no small disturbance of the equilibrium of one’s temper. We do not know that in this concert every instrument is played in all respects right; we do not know but some notes may have been omitted, or wrong tones produced, but certain are we that we did not discover any such imperfections. There are four things, (technical points,) that we have seldom heard well exhibited elsewhere, which were exceedingly well brought out here, viz.: Piano, Crescendo, Diminuendo and Fortzando. These, with the other technicals of playing were so well observed, that added to the pure tone peculiar to each particular instrument, and connected with a most perfect amalgamation or blending of all the different elements of the orchestra, they seemed to produce, not a mere musical performance to be listened to, but a living being, or moral, spiritual existence, capable of expressing the deepest feeling, and of calling forth the strongest sympathies of humanity.
The Sinfonie being over, and a few moments for rest having been given, old Handel visited us in an Arie from his Opera “Aerio” — “Folle e colui che al tuo favor si fida.” It was sung by Herrn Salvatore Marchesi, who was the only vocalist for the evening. The song was well sung; but we sometimes hear quite as good singing across the Atlantic. Belletti is decidedly his superior. The third piece was a Flute Concerto; it was a tiresome affair. A Flute Concerto is a Flute Concerto, whether in the Gewandhaus, Hanover Square rooms, Tripler Hall or the Melodeon; and although it may not be always played by Herrn W. Haake, (who certainly did his duty well,) it is always the most dry and uninteresting of musical performances.
In part 2d was given, 1st, the beautiful overture Echoes of Ossian, (often played in New York and Boston,) by N. W. Gade. 2d. Arie from Zauberflote, by Mozart, “Qui sdegno non s' accende."" 3d. Mendelssohn’s concerto for the piano forte, in D. Minor. 4th. Arie from Don Giovanni, by Mozart, “Madamina, il catalogo e questo,"" and 5th. The very fine overture to the opera, “Der Wassertrager,” by Cherubini.
Gade’s overture may be regarded as a sacred piece. It speaks of greatness, and calls forth emotions of the sublime. Something like an Old Chorale pervades the whole, which seems to tell of worship, and to call forth humble adoration. With what grandeur this subject was given out, and oft in the course of the piece alluded to by the brass instruments, or exemplified and illustrated by the others, cannot be told. The overture is known with us, but it requires and deserves dose study.
The Piano Forte Concerto, D (not G) Minor, failed for want of a performer; a highly promising young lad of the conservatory attempted it, but he had neither grasp of mind nor of hand enough for Mendelssohn. Herr Marchesi sang both airs well, gaining for himself decided applause.
On the whole, here is a highly-talented and well-regulated orchestra. The conductor for the evening was Julius Rietz, well known to the musical world.
I will mention one or two things about the audience:
1st. Gentlemen took off their hats before passing the door of the hall, all of them, without a single exception; and this, although they were there an hour before the performance commenced. There was not a single man standing under the galleries or near the doors, uncovered. The ungentlemanly act of standing or sitting in a concert room with hats on, could not be seen in the Gewandhaus.
2d. Ladies were all in full dress.
3d. There was silence during the performance of music. The moment the music ceased, then indeed there was a perfect buzzing of voices, and very loud talking all over the room; but at the signal for the commencement of the music, all was still; and we were not prevented from hearing the music by those whisperings, so annoying in some places.
On the whole, this was a very fine concert; the orchestra playing was as near to perfection, I doubt not, as can often be found; and that constitutes the great attraction of the Gewandhaus. Every man seems to be able to play on his own instrument well; every man seems to give undivided attention to the music, and to endeavor to observe carefully, not only the time, as given by the conductor, but all those little gesticulations by which expression is indicated.

One of&nbsp;the fetes organised by the patricians and artists of Pesth&nbsp;in honour of the great national rejoicing was announced&nbsp;under the amazing title of ""A Fools' Evening, given by&nbsp;the Committee of Folly,"" and came off one Sunday&nbsp;evening in the Grand Redoute, with the co-operation of&nbsp;over five thousand persons of both sexes, one and all&nbsp;earnestly bent upon proving themselves, in appearance&nbsp;and behaviour, bereft of their senses. The entertainment lasted ten hours; and I am bound to say that,&nbsp;from beginning to end, it was an uninterrupted and&nbsp;kaleidoscopic display of more or less humorous insanity...After the possessor of a voucher (himself necessarily travestied into some maniacal seeming) had&nbsp;passed the ordeal of examination by the Committee,&nbsp;stationed on the grand staircase, he was received with&nbsp;triumphal blasts, at the main entrance to the hall, by a ""Mad Orchestra"" consisting of ten bugles, eight side-drums, and one violin... A second&nbsp;later they ""jumped to the eye,"" as the French idiom&nbsp;hath it, on a raised platform at the further end of the&nbsp;hall, pent up in an enormous built cage some twenty&nbsp;feet high, and constituting an orchestra, eighty in number, assiduously engaged in performing The Beautiful&nbsp;Blue Danube. The disguises were admirable, and had&nbsp;been allotted to the wearers in such sort as to intensify&nbsp;the general incongruity suggested by furred and feathered music-makers. For instance, the leading flautist&nbsp;was an elephant, whose aspect whilst diligently blowing&nbsp;his Querpfeife under his trunk was irresistibly comical.&nbsp;The triangle was being gravely tingled by a Royal&nbsp;Bengal tiger of alarmingly truculent mien ; a portly old&nbsp;lion, his tail comfortably adjusted across his knee, led&nbsp;the violoncelli ; a solemn pelican was tooting the French&nbsp;horn, its mouthpiece inserted in the side of his bill ; the&nbsp;drums were being administered to by a mild-eyed grey&nbsp;bullock of the true Banat breed ; side by side, amongst&nbsp;the first violins, were a bear, a colossal perch, and a frog&nbsp;of prediluvian dimensions ; the two bassoons were deftly&nbsp;handled by a mammoth spider and a shiny sturgeon,&nbsp;whilst a giant prairie tortoise clashed the cymbals as&nbsp;though that were the exclusive function to fulfil which was his inborn mission in life. The leader, a famous German chef d'orchestre — appeared as a gorilla of unexampled hideousness, quite the most appalling creature&nbsp;my eyes had ever thitherto beheld; and he conducted&nbsp;with a mimic knotted club formidably suggestive of&nbsp;""homicide with intention.'' The whole tableau was&nbsp;irresistibly provocative of convulsive and inextinguishable laughter. Moreover, facing this zoological band, at&nbsp;the opposite end of the hall was installed another ""full""&nbsp;orchestra, consisting of life-size puppets set in motion&nbsp;by machinery, and occupying the lid of a Brobding-nagian musical box, the inside of which was tenanted&nbsp;by a real live military band in full play, so that its&nbsp;strains, produced by an unseen agency, seemed to proceed from the dolls, whose conductor, a singularly limber&nbsp;automaton, rivalled his dos-a-dos, the gorilla, in wildly&nbsp;energetic action. Taken in connection with the practice of the divine art, the orchestral menagerie was the&nbsp;funniest sight a musician could hope to look upon in&nbsp;the flesh. Of the puppet band one wearied readily; not&nbsp;so of the harmonious wild beasts, whose infinite variety''&nbsp;custom "" could not stale.""&nbsp;",186u-uu-uu,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/0b0565cb9b2c6832d072132c489cd229,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/aa342adedcaea05dbbf237cfb73657e5/1446674764459,Indoor Accompanied Public,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/William+Beatty-Kingston/1444079044346,William Beatty-Kingston,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_music

In short, expectation was wound up to its highest pitch, when he suddenly arrived, in bad health, and immediately gave a performance at the Opera-House, on March 9th, 1831. The calm and judicious veteran of the Royal Conservatory of Music in Belgium, M. FETIS, who knew him well, and heard him often, and to whose work I am so much indebted for the present sketch, can find no other words to express the sensation which he created on his first appearance at Paris than "" universal frenzy."" The whole city flocked to hear him, the professors and virtuosi crowded round him on the platform, as near as they dared approach, in order to watch him play, after which they were no wiser than before. At the end of each piece the whole audience, it is said, rose en masse to recall him ; the tongue of envy forgot to wag, and rivalry was put out of court. It was hoped he might have thrown some light upon certain prodigious violin studies which he had published, and which had long been known at Paris. No one could play them, or even conjecture how some of them were to be played; nor did PAGANINI reveal the secret, which lay, no doubt, partly in a peculiar way of tuning the instrument, as well as in a length and agility of finger which he alone possessed.",http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/day/1831-03-09,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/289f9fe6ded394b91990102e8e9c60bb,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/b47bf7268240723704d8e8c9d4330644/1437843739216,Accompanied Indoor Public,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Concert+audience/1437843691449,Concert audience,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Violin,

The principal star of the season, Madame Sontag, next appeared, inspired by her Parisian honours, in Donizetti's ""Don Pasquale,"" accompanied by the ever welcome ever great Lablache, together with Calzolari and Beletti. Each shining nightly in popular favour, they composed a charming constellation in this gay little opera. Madame Sontag was received on her rentree as only Jenny Lind had been received of late years. The London audience not only acknowledged its own gratification for the past in this reception, but its sense also of the triumph in the French capital. She appeared as fresh, young, and girlish in her buoyancy as ever. The magic effects of the ""fontaine de jouvence,"" that enviable marvel, seemed still upon her.

Various conductors have contributed their share towards the musical development of the [Handel and Haydn] Society.
Mr. Charles Horn, the English song-writer, was, I believe, imported in order to bring out the oratorio of Elijah. I think he was followed by John L. Hatton. This gentleman was a very fine musician and composer, an excellent pianist, and, mirable dictu, an exceptionally fine, unctuous singer of comic songs.
Think of it, classicists of the present day,— the director of the Handel and Haydn Society a famous singer of comic songs ! I can assure my readers, though, that when Mr. Hatton sang The Little Fat Man, Bluebeard, or The Jolly Young Oysterman (words by Oliver Wendell Holmes, music by Hatton), he satisfied very largely the aesthetic tastes of the day. It is also to be remembered that there are comic songs and comic songs.

The musical parties at Brighton were a source of very mixed satisfaction to me. I believe I always had the instinct of a virtuoso, and I certainly had the irritability and impatience of one. It was not de rigueur at Brighton to listen to anyone, but I never could bear playing to people who did not listen. In mixed companies I resorted to every conceivable trick and device to ensnare attention; and I am quite aware as STERNDALE BENNETT, who accompanied the first solo I ever played in a public concert room, told me some years afterwards that I injured my style by a partiality for crude and sensational effect, which my better judgment even then revolted from.",185u-uu-uu,,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/a74da3398c52062ba937308ca0813861/1437729316764,Indoor Domestic Accompanied,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Sterndale+Bennett/1437729193970,Sterndale Bennett,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Piano http://dbpedia.org/resource/Violin,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Accompaniment

Public performances by some one of them are very frequent; so frequent indeed, that we can find time for only now and then one. The first for the season was by the ""Sacred Harmonic Society,"" under Mr. Costa, and consisted of a selection from ""Samson,"" by Handel, Mendelssohn's ""Christus,"" ""The Last Judgment,"" by Spohr. The death of the illustrious Duke gave a tinge to all the earlier concerts, and the ""Dead March"" in Saul was in constant requisition. On the present occasion, the selection from ""Samson"" consisted of the air, ""Ye Sons of Israel,"" ""Dead March,"" and chorus,&nbsp;
""Glorious hero, may thy grave&nbsp;Peace and honor ever have.""&nbsp;
The ""Christus"" by Mendelssohn, seems to be very popular, both among the singers and hearers. The chorale, ""As bright the Star of Morning gleams,"" one of the best German chorales, and one that is very often heard in their churches, is brought in with fine effect after the chorus, ""There shall a Star of Jacob&nbsp;come forth."" Mendelssohn is always great in such choruses as ""He stirreth up the Jews,"" ""Crucify Him,"" and others in which he depends mostly upon orchestral effect, and in which he carries out his ideas of imitation or description with all the powers of modem instrumentation.&nbsp;
Spohr's oratorio was well given, the Gresham Professor himself being judge; for we had the honor of a seat by his side, and of listening to his remarks during the perormance. Mr. Taylor was the first to bring out Spohr in England. ""Die letzten Dinge,"" or ""The Last Things,"" (which is a much better title for the oratorio than the one it now bears,) was composed about twenty-five years ago. It accidently came into the hands of Prof. Taylor, who translated the words, and first brought it out at the Norwich Festival in 1830. Since then it has been a standard oratorio, and is often performed. Prof. Taylor says: ""It at once seized the public attention, and commanded the admiration of the most distinguished professors of every school. Its influences upon the feelings of an audience has been attested by expressions more decided and unequivocal than I ever remember to have witnessed. I speak not of the admiration which the musician derives from such a display of the power and the resources of his art, but of the homage which nature, though musically untutored, involuntarily yet willingly pays to genius. The throbbing heart, the moistening eye, the quivering lip, here bespeak the triumph of the composer."" The solo parts&nbsp;were sustained by Mrs. Endersohn, Miss Williams, Mr. Lockey and Mr. Phillips.&nbsp;
We cannot enter into the detail of this performance; suffice it to say, that it afforded some of the best specimens of solo, quartet and chorus singing which we have ever heard. It was&nbsp;performed with admirable promptitude and exactness, as is everything else that is brought under the bâton of Mr. Costa.",http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/day/1853-01-11,http://dbpedia.org/resource/London,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/ceb97cdfb9fd4bc8cebcc50d8ed61686/1461779332856,Accompanied Public Indoor,http://musicbrainz.org/artist/f422b99a-b48c-4bee-bc0c-f2e8cad82b6c#_ http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Edward+Taylor/1461779056247,Dr. Lowell Mason Lowell Mason Edward Taylor,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Choir http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra http://dbpedia.org/resource/Male_vocals http://dbpedia.org/resource/Female_vocals,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oratorio

I went to Paris expressly to attend this most interesting premiere, which took place on November 28, 1888. Seats were not only at a high premium but virtually unobtainable, and I owed the&nbsp;possession of mine to the courtesy of Jean de &nbsp;Reszke. Many a time I have looked upon the &nbsp;heavily gilded and slightly sombre interior of the &nbsp;Paris Opera-house, but never when it contained&nbsp;such an audience, such a gathering of famous men,&nbsp;of elegant, jewel-bedecked women, as appeared &nbsp;there on that memorable night. The grandes &nbsp;dames of the French aristocracy were present, displaying a sartorial splendor that recalled the &nbsp;halcyon days of the Second Empire, and what that&nbsp;implied I can only leave my fair readers to guess. &nbsp;On taking the conductor's seat, Gounod was overwhelmed with acclamations. His calm, serene &nbsp;countenance wore an encouraging smile, and no one would have dreamed that the veteran composer was as anxious as though it were the first &nbsp;performance of a brand-new opera. At the outset, indeed, every one was nervous. &nbsp;Many years had elapsed since Mme. Patti had appeared at the Opera, and, often as she had enacted &nbsp;Juliette - this was the first time she had sung the &nbsp;part in French; in the waltz air — long one of her&nbsp;favorite concert-pieces — she did what was for her the rarest imaginable thing: she made a slip &nbsp;that carried her four bars ahead of the accompaniment (“Elle sautait quatre mesures!” as &nbsp;Gounod subsequently put it). Yet, thanks to her extraordinary presence of mind, the great prima donna regained her place so quickly that probably &nbsp;not twenty persons in the audience noticed the &nbsp;error. Moreover, she sang the whole waltz with such grace and entrain that an encore was inevitable, and on the repetition her rendering of it was &nbsp;the most brilliant I have ever heard her give. The &nbsp;youthfulness and charm of her assumption were &nbsp;astounding, while her fine acting in the more tragic &nbsp;scenes indicated a startling advance in histrionic &nbsp;force over her effort in the same opera ten years &nbsp;earlier. &nbsp;&nbsp;The new Romeo proved worthy of his association with this perfect Juliette. The mere fact that it was Jean de Reszke may be deemed sufficient guarantee of that to-day; it is not easy, however, to convey an idea of the striking revelation which&nbsp;his impersonation offered as, step by step, scene by scene, it unfolded itself for the first time upon &nbsp;the same plane with Patti's exquisite conception. &nbsp;Every attribute that distinguished the one arose,&nbsp;strong and clear-cut, in the other. Never before, &nbsp;at least in their operatic mold, had the hapless &nbsp;Veronese lovers been so faultlessly matched.&nbsp;Where was “monotony”, where was “tedium”, now? The interest of that delicious sequence of&nbsp;love-duets acquired a fresh intensity, and became &nbsp;“cumulative"" in such a degree that the final scene &nbsp;in the tomb formed a veritable climax of musical &nbsp;as well as dramatic grandeur. The genius of &nbsp;Gounod stood in a new light; and his personal triumph on this occasion was a fitting corollary to &nbsp;that of the great artists who were his chief interpreters. Again and again did they appear before&nbsp;the curtain, hand in hand, an illustrious trio, — &nbsp;to be converted into an illustrious quartet after Edouard de Reszke had invested with his own &nbsp;unique organ notes the grateful phrases of Frere &nbsp;Laurent. From first to last, it was a historic performance.",1888-uu-uu,,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/a912511e7d717ccda2064dfc8b911c94/1438428421492,Indoor Public Accompanied,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Hermann+Klein/1438157240872,Hermann Klein,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

Siegfried Wagner came twice to London. In the autumn of 1894 he challenged criticism as a conductor only, and was “let off” pretty lightly. He &nbsp;wielded the baton with his left hand, but his beat &nbsp;was firm and distinct, and his readings, if colorless, were intelligent and clear. In the summer of&nbsp;1895 he appeared as a composer, and presented to &nbsp;the world, for the first time, a symphonic poem written after Schiller's “Sehnsucht. ""This work revealed promise, but it was “the promise of the &nbsp;child who tries to run before he can walk, the prematurely exposed talent of the artist who represents on canvas some great problem of human life &nbsp;before he has mastered the art of mixing his colors."" At the same concert he gave a practical &nbsp;demonstration of his father's ideas concerning the&nbsp;interpretation of Beethoven's “little” symphony in &nbsp;F. On the other hand, his reading of the “Der Freischutz” overture was “simply remarkable for &nbsp;wilful eccentricity and a flagrant disregard for the &nbsp;obvious intentions of the composer.""",1895-uu-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/London,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/0db7064b462e607f150289d05a7559b5/1438534993940,Public Accompanied Indoor,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Hermann+Klein/1438157240872,Hermann Klein,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Symphony

In the evening to the theatre. M. Huet from the Opera Comique of Paris drew a full house. He played Adolphe, and Jean de Paris, in the originals, from which Matrimony and John of Paris have been translated; but I thought him very tame and insipid after the delightfully spirited performance of Elliston in the same parts;—who is so happy in the combination of heart and feeling with vivacity and whim; and inimitable in the management of dry humour and playful raillery.

Her Majesty's Theatre, then, opened on the 15th of March, with Alboni, now in the height of her popularity, as Cenerentola. The success of this great singer was necessarily triumphant; and the season, in appearance at all events, could not have commenced under happier auspices. The public is a child in many respects— in many respects, too, a spoiled child, a very spoiled child. It cried still for its favourite toy — Jenny Lind. However brilliant the new toy placed before it for its delectation and amusement, it would not take to it as, under other circumstances, it might have done.

The only substitute to be found for the announced opera was Donizetti's unfortunate ""Adelia,"" which, as I have recorded, had not been successful on its production during the previous year. When revived for the opening of the season, on the 9th of March 1844, it was supported again by Madame Persiani; Corelli, the new tenor, appearing in the part originally sustained by Conti. Persiani, though now somewhat on the wane, was one of the favourites of the day. Corelli was generally pronounced a pleasant tenor, fitted for the Nemorinos of the stage, and so far an acquisition. But ""Adelia,"" although ""backed up"" by one of the most successful choreographic displays ever witnessed on the boards of Her Majesty's Theatre, would not, could not attract.

The large Exeter Hall was full of people, who seemed to be much delighted with the music; indeed I thought that there was more warmth of approval exhibited there than we usually see at the best concerts with us. The solo performers were Miss Pyne, Miss Louisa Pyne, Miss Binckes, Mr. Swift, (a new tenor,) Herr Jonghmans, Mr. Cotton, and Mr. Whitworth. Miss Goddard played serenade (Don Pasquale), by Thalberg, and also an andante and rondo capricioso by Mendelssohn, on the piano forte, and Mr. Richardson played an air with variations on the flute. Miss Binckes has a very fine voice, and sung to the great acceptance of the audience, and Miss Louisa Pyne sung quite a difficult aria by Rode, which called forth a most enthusiastic encore. The pieces for full choir were performed without accompaniment, not even the piano forte being played; and although I have heard a better chorus at home, yet this was truly good. The concert was conducted by Mr. T. H. Severn. The programme contained the music to the National Anthem, printed in full in four parts, and the whole audience joined in this the closing chorus:
&nbsp;
“God save our gracious Queen,
Long may Victoria reign;
God save the Queen!
Send her victorious,
Happy and glorious,
Long to reign over us,
God save the Queen!
&nbsp;
""O Lord our God arise,
Scatter her enemies,
And make them fall.
Confound their politics,
Frustrate their knavish tricks,
On Thee our hopes we fix,
God save us all.
&nbsp;
""Thy choicest gifts in store&nbsp;
On her be pleased to pour,
Long may she reign;
May she defend our laws,
And ever give us cause,
To sing with heart and voice,
God save the Queen!",1852-01-Mm,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/249e970d5f9a49b3819d2da3de7c2e7f,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/bacfb5766b68af0b46daf2a370d3f6df/1448275195123,Indoor Public Accompanied,,,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Piano,

Anticipating this, our company, consisting of three persons, went a little before the time appointed for the opening of the door; but yet we found a crowd gathered; the room filled immediately as the door was opened, but we succeeded in obtaining good seats. We had now to wait a full hour before the music commenced, but in the midst of such a multitude of good-looking and well-dressed ladies and gentlemen, all in conversation in loud and merry voices, it soon passed away. Half an hour before the commencement, the oboe was heard, running the scales, &amp;c.; this was soon followed by faggotti, corni, clarionetti, and strings; every man tuning and getting his instrument and his fingers in readiness. Mendelssohn seemed to look down from his bust immediately opposite the orchestra with approbation. At half-past six precisely, Kapelmeister Rietz takes his stand — the signal is given — every one is silent and attentive, and Beethoven’s overture (op. 124) fills the whole company with delight. This is a very pleasing overture; it is less learned, but of a more popular character than most of Beethoven’s. It is often marked with a rhythm like the music of the march or dance; and the flourishes of the brass instruments and drums almost lead one to suppose that he is listening to a military band. But still the hand of the master is seen, and although Beethoven comes down and freely holds conversation with the people, yet he always preserves his dignity, and never dishonors his profession in this pleasing composition.
A very good singer followed; Frau Leopoldine Tuczek-Herrenburg, from Berlin, in a Recitative and Arie from the opera of “Sylvana,” by C. Maria von Weber.
This was followed by a grand Concerto for the Piano Forte, with orchestral accompaniment (G moll), composed by J. Moschelles, and played by Clara Schumann. I have already spoken of Madame Schumann’s playing; her performance of this Concerto was perfect, and received the warmest approbation from the audience.
An air of De Beriot followed, by Frau Tuczek-Herrenburg; after which Madame Schumann played most charmingly a Notturno (B. major) for piano forte, by F. Chopin. In this she was encored, and played in answer to the call another piece unknown to the writer.
The second part of the concert was that in which the musical ones were most deeply interested, for it consisted of Robert Schumann's new Symphonie. This has not been published, and was played from manuscript, conducted by the author, who was cordially greeted on his appearance at the head of the orchestra. It is undoubtedly a work of great merit; but it is truly a great work, and can only be performed by a very thoroughly trained band. Its analogies and correspondencies are deeper and more hidden than in Mozart or Beethoven, but nevertheless they are there, and can be discovered to some extent even at a first hearing. The Symphonie consists of five movements, there being in addition to the usual movements a short adagio (fourth) introduced. In the second movement (scherzo), there is playfulness and relief, but throughout the whole the idea of greatness prevails; so much so as almost to oppress one with a feeling of grandeur and sublimity. The fourth movement especially seems to partake in the highest degree of this character, and stirs up the deep feelings to awe and reverence. But vain is any attempt at description, especially by one who has heard it but at a single performance. It was played with great energy; every member of the orchestra had enough to do. The captain inspired confidence, and the result was most satisfactory. There was but a momentary pause between the parts, and in this respect the learned conductor’s example is well worthy of imitation. The Symphonie occupied thirty-three minutes in its performance, and at half-past eight the concert closed.",http://data.open.ac.uk/time/interval/1852-03-uuT18:30:00/to/1852-03-uuT20:30:00,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/0a19459865ed69275723d6efb76048c9,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/f61587329eac3874b8115efe2b614bb0/1448310154462,Indoor Accompanied Public,http://musicbrainz.org/artist/f422b99a-b48c-4bee-bc0c-f2e8cad82b6c#_,Dr. Lowell Mason Lowell Mason,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra http://dbpedia.org/resource/Piano,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Concerto

In the winter of 1846 the first moderately complete orchestra, known as the Steyermark Orchestra, came to the United States from Europe. They numbered about twenty men, good players, with Francis Riha as first violin and director, who afterward became the second violin of the Mendelssohn Quintette Club. They played mostly light dance music, overtures, potpourris, and solos. They did everything with great “ chic ” or “ snap,” which was a new thing to our people.
Riha was an exceedingly handsome young man, graceful in every motion, very talented in composition, and a fine violinist The artists wore the picturesque Steyermark country uniform. They had little clinking, cymbal-like bits of metal attached to the heels of their long boots, and when playing certain characteristic pieces they used to knock their heels together and produce a clear, lively sound which “ took ” with the audience. They played nightly for about a month in the old Melodeon and then went off on a concert tour.",1846-Ll-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boston,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/dc32bfa204e26006d62d0226e4408c6c/1450194301530,Public Indoor Accompanied,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Thomas+Ryan/1448997315048,Thomas Ryan,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Violin,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dance_music

It is very rare at Rome to find a meeting of a few individuals which is not disturbed by a quarrel, often terminating with the coltellate.
At Florence, on the contrary, on occasion of their many ceremonies and public fêtes, frequently the largest crowds assemble peaceably: on the festival of the Assumption, especially, the inhabitants of Florence and its environs assemble early in the morning in the vast and delicious walks of the Casinos, on the borders of the Arno. There all ranks are mingled and confounded by pleasure: the day is passed in joy; the air resounds with songs, and with the sounds of the musical instruments which animate the steps of the dancers; and in the shade of the pines and chesnut-trees small parties seat themselves on the turf to enjoy a rural repast.
&nbsp;The festival frequently extends far into the night, but there is not a single instance of a quarrel attended with bloodshed; and yet there are more than twenty thousand persons collected and enclosed in one place:—this made me love the Tuscans.",17Ll-uu-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Florence,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/74a77f8f3e2b7cfc427b9239109a8836/1517847137355,Accompanied Public Outdoor,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Antoine+Laurent+Castellan/1517842957331,Antoine-Laurent Castellan,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice http://dbpedia.org/resource/Musical_instrument,

In his Carnaval de Ventse, he exhibited a mastery over every form of violin technics which quite reached the marvellous. His chromatic scale, played staccato from the lowest to the highest note, and down again to the lowest, in one bow,— either an up or down bow,—was a feat, a tour de force, shown us by no other virtuoso. His double trills and double harmonics were perfect. Nor was it in mere technical playing that he was great, for he played with much sentiment and feeling, and in quartette playing he showed his best quality. He was the master-player and king of all I have heard.

The Saint's day [St. Abbondio] was ushered in by all the splendour of Italian skies; the waters were blue and brilliant as the heavens: every steeple sparkled in the sunshine; and every bell tolled, from the shores of the Chiavenna, to the Duomo of Como. Not a mountain, not a paese in the district, but had yielded up its inhabitants to the festivity of the season: some issued forth upon the lake, in their various holiday garb, of bright and gaudy colours, rowing their loaded boat, which sunk deep in the water by its heavy weight; others sailed gallantly, with fluttering canvass and flaunting banners: while the inland votarists came pouring down the acclivities of Saint Fermo and Saint Elmo (the women distinguishable afar by their glittering bodkins), all bending their steps to that venerable Dome, where glittered in large golden characters—""Indulgenza Plenaria."" The day began with a musical mass, at which the Bishop of Como officiated in pontificalibus; the whole sumptuous parade of the most sumptuous and most attractive of all religions was exhibited; and the same orchestra which performed the ""Cenerentola,"" at the Opera, the night before, and symphonized the triumphs of the Glass Slipper, now with the exact same strains (the brilliant harmonies of Rossini) accompanied the most solemn and imposing ceremonies of the most holy of mysteries.

The concert room is not large, but convenient, and good for musical effect. The centre of the room is occupied by ladies, and the outer seats mostly by gentlemen. A narrow gallery, in which are a number of private boxes, runs round the room. The first object of attraction, after entering the room, is a fine large medallion of Mendelssohn, back of the orchestra; there is no other bust or picture in the room. It makes one feel sod when looking at this fine representation of the great modem composer, in the very room where he has been, and still is, so highly appreciated, and where he has so often triumphed gloriously, to think that he was cut off in his youth, and that the musical world, after so short a time of enjoyment, was deprived of the talents and learning of one who promised to do for music, perhaps, more than any man living. At almost every concert, more or less of his music is performed; his memory is cherished, not only here, where he was so well known, but by all the musical world, and his name shall be held in everlasting remembrance.
A crowd of people were waiting round the door, when we arrived; and, although it was an hour before the time for the performance to commence, the room was filled, (save the reserved seats in the gallery,) in a few minutes after the door was opened. One must be on hand at an early hour to get a good seat. In about half an hour the members of the orchestra began to make their appearance, and as all the people in the house were talking loud, so the musicians, as they came in, one after another, began to tune, to try their instruments, and to amuse themselves by running over the scales; so that by the time they were all there, thus employed, the room was filled with sound; the more so because, as the musicians began to exercise themselves upon their instruments, the talking and laughing grew louder and louder, and at a quarter of an hour before the commencement of the music, it was a perfect Babel in the concert room, and as difficult to hear one speak as it is in a railroad car, with all the windows open, in summer. But a few minutes before the hour, the room began to grow quiet, musical expectation began to awaken, and when, as the precise moment arrived, the conductor’s signal was heard, everything was still, and perfect silence took the place of noise and confusion. Another signal, and the whole band, as one man, were heard interpreting and presenting to a most attentive audience, one of the great works of the immortal Beethoven.
It was the Sinfonie No. 8, F major. This is not regarded as one of Beethoven’s greatest triumphs; but, although it is light and playful, it abounds in each of its four movements, with the most fanciful and imaginative melodic figures, contrapuntal points, and instrumental contrasts. Ever lively and ever new, it never tires, but holds one in a kind of musical ecstasy from beginning to end; there seems to be no place where one can relax attention, or cease to be filled with musical delight; so that at the close of each part, a good long breath naturally comes in as a relief; and one becomes conscious of the intensity of the application he has been giving to the discourse.
The very first thing which strikes one, on hearing such an orchestra as this, is the perfect oneness of the violins. They do, indeed, constitute a perfect chorus — ten or more persons are playing the first violin, and as many more the second; but they are all artists, and, therefore, each one loses himself; no one is heard above the others; but all so beautifully blend as to constitute one perfect whole. This is the perfection of a chorus, be it vocal or instrumental; and this effect is produced by the Gewandhaus Orchestra.
Another point, immediately noticed, is the proper proportion of wind and stringed instruments; but perhaps the most striking point, as contrasted with our American orchestras, is the perfection of the wind instruments. It is too often the case in our orchestras that some wind instrument is wanting; thus the oboe or the faggotto is often missing; and again, it is not unfrequently the case that, although there may be some one to hold these or other instruments in the hand, or up to the sight of the audience, a tone is seldom permitted to escape from them; they are seen but not heard, Not so here; every instrument is not only represented to the eye, but is in the hands of a master who makes it speak to the ear. The consequence is, that such combinations fall upon the ear as are not heard with us. The brass instruments too are made to tell their story without any impediment of speech; whereas, with us, they stutter, or falter, or hem, or cough, to the no small disturbance of the equilibrium of one’s temper. We do not know that in this concert every instrument is played in all respects right; we do not know but some notes may have been omitted, or wrong tones produced, but certain are we that we did not discover any such imperfections. There are four things, (technical points,) that we have seldom heard well exhibited elsewhere, which were exceedingly well brought out here, viz.: Piano, Crescendo, Diminuendo and Fortzando. These, with the other technicals of playing were so well observed, that added to the pure tone peculiar to each particular instrument, and connected with a most perfect amalgamation or blending of all the different elements of the orchestra, they seemed to produce, not a mere musical performance to be listened to, but a living being, or moral, spiritual existence, capable of expressing the deepest feeling, and of calling forth the strongest sympathies of humanity.
The Sinfonie being over, and a few moments for rest having been given, old Handel visited us in an Arie from his Opera “Aerio” — “Folle e colui che al tuo favor si fida.” It was sung by Herrn Salvatore Marchesi, who was the only vocalist for the evening. The song was well sung; but we sometimes hear quite as good singing across the Atlantic. Belletti is decidedly his superior. The third piece was a Flute Concerto; it was a tiresome affair. A Flute Concerto is a Flute Concerto, whether in the Gewandhaus, Hanover Square rooms, Tripler Hall or the Melodeon; and although it may not be always played by Herrn W. Haake, (who certainly did his duty well,) it is always the most dry and uninteresting of musical performances.
In part 2d was given, 1st, the beautiful overture Echoes of Ossian, (often played in New York and Boston,) by N. W. Gade. 2d. Arie from Zauberflote, by Mozart, “Qui sdegno non s' accende."" 3d. Mendelssohn’s concerto for the piano forte, in D. Minor. 4th. Arie from Don Giovanni, by Mozart, “Madamina, il catalogo e questo,"" and 5th. The very fine overture to the opera, “Der Wassertrager,” by Cherubini.
Gade’s overture may be regarded as a sacred piece. It speaks of greatness, and calls forth emotions of the sublime. Something like an Old Chorale pervades the whole, which seems to tell of worship, and to call forth humble adoration. With what grandeur this subject was given out, and oft in the course of the piece alluded to by the brass instruments, or exemplified and illustrated by the others, cannot be told. The overture is known with us, but it requires and deserves dose study.
The Piano Forte Concerto, D (not G) Minor, failed for want of a performer; a highly promising young lad of the conservatory attempted it, but he had neither grasp of mind nor of hand enough for Mendelssohn. Herr Marchesi sang both airs well, gaining for himself decided applause.
On the whole, here is a highly-talented and well-regulated orchestra. The conductor for the evening was Julius Rietz, well known to the musical world.
I will mention one or two things about the audience:
1st. Gentlemen took off their hats before passing the door of the hall, all of them, without a single exception; and this, although they were there an hour before the performance commenced. There was not a single man standing under the galleries or near the doors, uncovered. The ungentlemanly act of standing or sitting in a concert room with hats on, could not be seen in the Gewandhaus.
2d. Ladies were all in full dress.
3d. There was silence during the performance of music. The moment the music ceased, then indeed there was a perfect buzzing of voices, and very loud talking all over the room; but at the signal for the commencement of the music, all was still; and we were not prevented from hearing the music by those whisperings, so annoying in some places.
On the whole, this was a very fine concert; the orchestra playing was as near to perfection, I doubt not, as can often be found; and that constitutes the great attraction of the Gewandhaus. Every man seems to be able to play on his own instrument well; every man seems to give undivided attention to the music, and to endeavor to observe carefully, not only the time, as given by the conductor, but all those little gesticulations by which expression is indicated.

As in duty bound I had shown the song to the Principal. I felt as though I were laying bare the innermost recesses of my soul as I sang the words, into which, by the way, I put as little expression as possible, “pour me donner une contenance,” but either he was too busy listening to the music or he was too kind to chaff me about them. In spite of the dreadful sentimentality of the words - perhaps for that very reason - the song had an unqualified success. It was loudly encored, and both the singer and I stepped off the platform highly pleased with each other. I had never written anything the least like it. It belonged to the same category of songs as Sir Arthur Sullivan’s “Let me dream again” and “Once Again’’ - two songs which one never hears now, but which had an immense vogue at the time they were written.",187u-Ll-uu,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/bc180dbc583491c00f8a1cd134f7517b,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/8bd9c4e3a531142a5c198acbd07837f9/1452077531054,Indoor Accompanied,http://musicbrainz.org/artist/eca4d562-1e5c-409a-89fa-5489d102cdcb#_,Maude V.

I first heard him play on April 6, when he went to the Royal Academy to hand over to the committee of management the sum of £1100, raised through the efforts of Walter Bache for the foundation of a “Liszt scholarship"" at that institution. The shout of joy uttered by the students when he sat down at the piano was something to remember. It was followed by an intense silence. Then the aged but still nimble fingers ran lightly over the keys, and I was listening for the first time in my life to Franz Liszt. To attempt to describe his playing, after the many well-known Weimar pupils and distinguished writers who have tried to accomplish that task, would be mere presumption on my part. Even at seventy-five, Liszt was a pianist whose powers lay beyond the pale to which sober language or calm criticism could reach or be ap- plied. Enough that his greatest charm seemed to me to lie in a perfectly divine touch, and in a tone more remarkable for its exquisitely musical quality than for its volume or dynamic force, aided by a technique still incomparably brilliant and superb.",http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/day/1886-04-06,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Royal_Academy_of_Music,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/1b5892b34c38e216f7fa74dbcbcc2702/1438262892342,Accompanied Public Indoor,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Hermann+Klein/1438157240872,Hermann Klein,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Piano,

The ALBERGO DE' POVERJ is an enormous poor-house, begun by Charles the Third, and not yet completed. It contains one thousand five hundred men and boys, and seven hundred women. […] There are likewise [at the poor-house] a Lancastrian school; a music school; schools for different arts; a theatre; a chapel; and a college, in which pensioners are admitted. The whole of the wards, as well for sleeping as for use during the day, are as clean as the best private house; the food is of a good quality; and the children well clothed and healthy. The boys are trained to arms, and the movements of the institution are conducted by beat of drum.

It was an old ballad, which I had heard once before : —
'Say, have you in the village seen A lonely youth, of pensive mien? If such a one hath passed by, With melancholy in his eye, Where is he gone ? Ah, tell me where! Tis Allan Brook, of Windermere.' 
It was sung by Miss Jane. Her pensive look, and the soft accents of her voice, enchanted me. The spell, however, was suddenly broken by the wine- drinkers bursting into the room. They had listened to the song, and begged to hear it again. The Captain, however, with good taste, called upon his daughter to sing him his favourite : —
 ""In the world's crooked path where I've been, There to share of life's gloom my poor part, The bright sunshine that softened the scene Was a smile from the girl of my heart."" 
This was loudly applauded.I had crept into a corner during this interval, when my fair one asked me to sing. I was aware that nothing tender or sentimental would please at this moment, and I hit upon the convivial strain which Purcel sang to Charles the Second [...] The merriment was silenced by a flash of lightning, and the large drops of rain drove the ladies from the verandah.",17Ll-uu-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Earl_Shilton,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/1fbae31cbee288f9ebc9b13047915ae3/1444726608024,Indoor Accompanied Domestic,http://bnb.data.bl.uk/id/person/GardinerWilliam1770-1853,William  Gardiner William Gardiner,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Popular_music http://dbpedia.org/resource/Song

&nbsp;
A half-circle was formed around the prize committee, who had taken seats around the stage just in the rear of the table on which were placed the shining vessels of gold and silver. Amidst the loudest shouts the Burgermeister Hammers ascended the tribune to announce the decision of the judges.
[...]
Each of these announcements was received with the waving of banners, the blast of trumpets, the rolling of drums, and the loud cheering of the multitude, which continued while the Mayor took from the table the prize, as it was announced, and handed it to the President of the Society to which it had been awarded. As soon as the cheering would permit, the President of the Bonn “Concordia” jumped upon the tribune and called for three times “Hurrah, and long life and prosperity to the friends in Dusseldorf,” to which a most enthusiastic response was given.

The night of Thursday, May the 18th, 1849, did really witness her ""last appearance upon any stage."" Jenny Lind retired in earnest, not, it is true, from the exercise of her profession, but from the theatrical boards, and this in the very zenith of her powers. Never perhaps during the whole of her career was there an occasion on which she bore away so great a triumph as when she appeared in the true sphere of her vocation for the last time This was a night of even unwonted sympathy and enthusiasm — a night of applause that seemed to know no bounds — a night of recalls, and again recalls, and one more last recall, as though the public could not part from her, or bear the thought of never looking upon her again.

Davison, the critic of the “Times” and proprietor of the “Musical World”; the man who helped Arthur Chappell to establish those famous concerts, and who for twenty years or more wrote the analytical programmes which constituted one of their most important educational features. One Saturday afternoon I was sitting by Davison's side as a glorious treat was nearing its close. Joachim had with marvelous fire led one of the “Rasoumowsky"" quartets; he had played the Bach “Chaconne"" as he alone in the world could play it; and now he was taking part in Schumann's noble pianoforte quintet, with Mme. Schumann, Louis Ries, Ludwig Straus, and Piatti for his companions. Just before the finale, the old critic turned to me and said in his abrupt, characteristic way : “”My boy, mind you mark this day with a red letter!

It was well done on both occasions, but was much the most effective in the “Sing Academie.” The choir was in excellent order, and consisted of about two hundred vocalists; the solo singing, though not by great artists, was all in good style and keeping, and the orchestra were fully adequate to the work they had to do. The recitatives were accompanied by the pianoforte, and the songs and choruses by the orchestra. There was no organ on either occasion, and I find that it is not common to unite the organ with a choir performance. If an orchestra play an overture, they are not supposed to need the support of an organ, and if a choir sing a vocal motette, they are supposed to be able to sing it independent of instrumental aid; so that the organ is seldom heard, except when it is telling its own story, or sustaining and leading along the great congregation in the choral songs.Every seat was occupied; indeed it was necessary to secure tickets a day or two previous to the performance. The king was there, and both the sovereign and the people seemed to enter into the spirit of the music. The house was perfectly still, and there was not the slightest indication of applause; not because the music was not well executed, but because the usual method of manifesting approbation seemed to be inappropriate to the solemn state of feeling existing. It seemed indeed to be an occasion of deep solemnity ; all the members of the choir, male and female, were dressed in black, so that an appeal was made, through the eye as well as the ear, to the religious sympathies in view of the sufferings of the Son of God. I shall not attempt any analysis of the “Tod Jesu.” With the exception of one chorus, and Luther’s chorale, it is, I believe, quite unknown in America[…]",1852-04-Ee,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/11e3eedd0c4e52428628d8ee96b1fa10,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/7c4e60fe750cc9274f3525f0e1bee079/1448313646227,Public Accompanied Indoor,http://musicbrainz.org/artist/f422b99a-b48c-4bee-bc0c-f2e8cad82b6c#_,Dr. Lowell Mason Lowell Mason,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra http://dbpedia.org/resource/Choir,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_music

Always remarkable for its refinement, distinction, and passionate warmth, his impersonation was just then peculiarly imbued with the spirit of the true Meyerbeer school. Alike in a vocal and a histrionic sense, it was supremely great. His ""velvety"" tones, fresh, clear, and mellow as a bell, were emitted with an unsparing freedom that would thrill the listener not once, but twenty times, in the course of a single scene. There was no saving up for the last act then; it was “laissez aller"" throughout, with plenty to spare at the finish. And what tenderness, withal, in that famous grand duet of the fourth act! Not Mario himself had phrased the “Tu m'ami, tu m'ami!"" (this was still an Italian performance) with a greater wealth of delicious surprise and pent-up adoration. Little wonder that Nordica nearly lost her head through nervousness and emotion. It was the very first time she sang Valentine; she had studied the part in less than a week, and for a young, inexperienced artist,— so youthful, so pretty, so winning that she fascinated others beside Raoul,— her achievement was in the highest degree creditable. The fifth act, generally suppressed in England, was on this occasion duly given, but the noise of the firing and the smoke from the gunpowder proved too much even for Augustus Harris. It was subsequently omitted, as usual.

Doyle’s father being a professor of music, he had received regular instructions in the art, and having a very sweet and touching voice, was able to accompany himself on the piano-forte. Kelly, on the other hand, who knew nothing of the science of music, and at that time, indeed, could hardly write his own name, had taken, when quite a youth, to the profession of the stage, and having a beautiful voice and a handsome face and person, met with considerable success. He and Doyle were inseparable companions, and their duets together were the delight of the gay supper-giving society in which they lived.&nbsp; The entertainments of this kind given by my joyous and social mother could, for gaiety at least, match with the best. Our small front and back drawing-rooms, as well as a little closet attached to the latter, were on such occasions distended to their utmost capacity ; and the supper-table in the small closet where people had least room was accordingly always the most merry. In the round of singing that followed these repasts my mother usually took a part, having a clear, soft voice, and singing such songs as “How sweet in the woodlands,” which was one of her greatest favourites, in a very pleasing manner. I was also myself one of the performers on such occasions, and gave some of Dibdin’s songs, which were at that time in high vogue, with no small éclat.",http://data.open.ac.uk/time/interval/1790-uu-uu/to/1799-uu-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dublin,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/817bb61b6cc4957587d5b021dffd3173/1558352114362,Domestic Accompanied Indoor,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Mrs+Anastasia+Moore/1558351429206 http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Guests+of+Anastasia+Moore/1558351738783 http://musicbrainz.org/artist/68b30416-113c-4c2e-8ca2-9a50a62fd5b7#_,Anastasia Jane Moore Guests of Anastasia Moore arr.

In the same category can scarcely be classed the ""Norma,"" which shortly followed, being first given by ""Royal command,"" on the occasion of a state visit of the Queen to Her Majesty's Theatre, on Tuesday, the 15th of June. Doubtless there was a great charm in the new version given to the character by the gifted young singer, who made an unextinguished love for the faithless Pollione more conspicuous than the rage of the deceived and slighted woman — in the bursts of emotion, which were rather those of agonised reproach than of implacable revenge — in the mournfulness rather than the passion of her despair, and in the tender resignation of her self-sacrifice there shone the great artist. But the English public, ever loyal to their idols, had been accustomed to another delineation of the slighted Druid Priestess. It had long gazed with emotion upon the burning passion, the withering indignation, and the imposing grandeur of Grisi, and could not be taught to relish a new ""treatment."" The interesting picture of womanly devotion, womanly anxiety and suffering, even of womanly forgiveness, as painted by Jenny Lind, however touching to behold, was evidently contrary to stage tradition. Dilettanti disputed, with psychological acumen on both sides, as to the respective truthfulness of the rival impersonations of Grisi and Jenny Lind ; but the public remained comparatively unimpressed. The attempt, in face of a recognised and familiar type, was thought to have been a mistake. At all events, ""Norma"" could hardly be counted among Jenny Lind's unquestionable triumphs.",http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/day/1847-06-15,,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/574cc7b414ce1c289d7e5ee2dbd5677c/1438704983595,Indoor Public Accompanied,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Benjamin+Lumley/1438607277398 http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Queen+Victoria/1393599242108,Benjamin Lumley Queen Victoria,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

Our concert room here is the Variety Theatre, a fair-sized barn, with doors on hinges up near the roof, opening for light and air. The sides are of weather-boards only, the roof shingled within hardwood, no lining; stars shine through; and as people commonly carry umbrellas, they are prepared to use them in case of a sudden shower. The night of the first concert, we had in the shilling part—rear end of the bam—about two hundred people, mostly miners. These gentlemen were prepared to enjoy the concert in their own way, nearly every one having a good honest clay pipe. The little wax matches which light with a snapping noise were going all the time,—you could plainly see the spark on the back ground of good thick smoke. As we had a large front part of house at four and three shillings, I made up my mind to try the effect of a coaxing appeal to the gentlemen in the rear to abstain from smoking. I spoke of the heat, close air, the general enjoyment which all would realize if they would abstain from smoking while the performances went on. It had the desired effect: they put up their pipes, were very quiet, attentive, and enthusiastic; but when approaching the end of part first, we could hear the little explosive matches on all sides going like fireworks, and at the last note up rose nearly every man, with a good head of pipe on, and marched out the side door, to take the air, and “ see a friend.”",188u-uu-uu,"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Maryborough,_Queensland",http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/fc02d15d2331ec0f91ce75527a66343f/1449478648715,Public Accompanied,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Thomas+Ryan/1448997315048,Thomas Ryan,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Female_vocals http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clarinet http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soprano http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flute http://dbpedia.org/resource/Violin http://dbpedia.org/resource/Viola,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_music

I ventured in, and found it a spacious place, the lower part occupied by men ; the women appearing behind a lattice work in the galleries. Having taken off my hat I was desired to put it on again. Each Jew has a little chest, from which he takes out his psalter, and a shawl to throw over his shoulders ; then puts down the lid, sits upon it, and joins the service. In a raised pew, in the centre, is placed a choir of five voices, who chant the psalms of David to Hebrew melodies. A youth of the name of Meets conducted the music, and sang with great taste ; but what attracted my attention most was a curious noise made by a young man who curtled, or grunted, an instrumental bass to the whole of the singing ; an attempt, no doubt, to imitate on the voice some of the ancient Jewish instruments. It was done with considerable skill, but had a most ridiculous effect. In a part of the service the congregation responded to the choir, in ejaculating notes, at regular intervals, which were dramatic and imposing. The priest retiring into the holy of holies, the principal singer introduced an air from the Zauberflote, by way of voluntary, or vocal display without any words. The priest then took from the ark the Levitical law, a roll of parchment highly decorated, which he unfurled with appropriate ceremonies. If the ancient Jewish melodies were as beautiful as those Marcello has handed down to us in his grand work of David's Psalms, the human voice must have been in a high state of cultivation in that early period.",182u-uu-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/London,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/6c7ae79cf19abebd45342e8ebca00d55/1444908430463,Public Accompanied Indoor,http://bnb.data.bl.uk/id/person/GardinerWilliam1770-1853,William  Gardiner William Gardiner,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice,

Since it was impossible to entertain any sound hopes of attraction from Verdi's ""last new"" opera. Mademoiselle Lind returned to her wonted triumphs (as did the theatre to its wonted ""crushes""), by resuming the parts in which now, as heretofore, she was sure to be rapturously hailed by the public. To these was added the Susanna of the ""Nozze di Figaro,"" to which character she brought not only her customary and recognised qualities as an accomplished singer, but the true Mozartian traditions. With these her early training had rendered her familiar, and subsequent study had confirmed the lesson. It was new to the public to listen to a singer so thoroughly imbued with the genius of Mozart, in one of his chefs d'oeuvre. Unlike many Italian singers, who considered that, in faithfully executing Mozart, they sacrificed themselves to the exigencies of an old- fashioned English predilection, Jenny Lind revelled in her music. Her whole soul was in the work.",1847-uu-uu,,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/3b4963c189994b0ebe93ae9252503423/1438706031091,Accompanied Indoor Public,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Benjamin+Lumley/1438607277398,Benjamin Lumley,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

I sang “My ain kind dearie.” I heard afterwards that it was that song that had made Sir Arthur [Sullivan] my friend, for he mentioned it to Signor Randegger, and referred amusingly to the hoarse voice in which I sang it. The hoarse voice, alas, is mine still, and on the day of the competition it was even more like a raucous bass than it is now, for I had hardly recovered from a really dreadful cough from which I had been suffering all the winter.

On one memorable occasion Rubinstein and Wieniawski did me the honor to spend an evening at my house in Boston. A right royal musical evening it was, shared by about fifty artist and amateur guests. We made much music,—beginning with Rubinstein’s String Quintette in F, op. 57. Then we had the Rasoumoffski Quartette in F, op. 57, by Beethoven, with Wieniawski playing first violin. Then the Schumann Piano Quintette, with Rubinstein at the piano. Oh, it was a joy to take part with such a man and in such a work! and how Rubinstein did spur us on by his passionate way of playing some of the great parts! his power was fierce and tremendous. I think we all revelled in the sea of sound we made about us.
After the Quintette, Rubinstein played a lot of choice solo pieces, ending the evening with the Chopin Polonaise in A flat, op. 53, in which comes the wonderful passage for the left hand in octaves. He began the phrase very soft, then the “little-by-little crescendo” was most admirably done, finally reaching a fortissimo power which was quite colossal. It stirred us all up, and set even the chandelier to jingling in sympathy, and possibly in admiration.",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boston,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/5b0363f9186e4ec68fb98251af207209/1449477494694,Domestic Indoor Accompanied,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Thomas+Ryan/1448997315048,Thomas Ryan,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Piano,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_music

In the evening to the theatre. M. Huet from the Opera Comique of Paris drew a full house. He played Adolphe, and Jean de Paris, in the originals, from which Matrimony and John of Paris have been translated; but I thought him very tame and insipid after the delightfully spirited performance of Elliston in the same parts;—who is so happy in the combination of heart and feeling with vivacity and whim; and inimitable in the management of dry humour and playful raillery.

In Christmas time, all quarters of Naples resound with Pastorali or Siciliane, a kind of simple rural music, executed by Abruzzese or Calabrian shepherds, upon a species of bag pipes, called in Abruzzo, Zampogna, and Ciaramelli in Calabria. The tunes vary according to the provinces: in the south, they have three different&nbsp;airs; the northern shepherds know only two, to which they add what variations the boldness of their own genius inspires. The boys learn of their fathers to play upon this instrument as the means of subsistence. At other seasons, it is rare to hear any agreeable sounds in the streets of Naples, though it is the nursery of musical professors: a school, where the greatest masters have imbibed their principles, and acquired that knowledge of composition, which has enchanted the ears of all Europe. There is no such thing as a national music, unless we give that name to a monotonous drawling seguidilla, that serves the nurses as a lullaby to put their children to rest, and&nbsp;seems borrowed from the Spaniards, who, I believe, learnt it of the Moors. I never resided in any Italian town where there was a less musical turn in the populace: few songs, guittars, vielles, or organs, enliven the evenings, as in the northern states of Italy, unless they be sent for to entertain the parties that in summer sup on the shore of Posilipo.

Surman. There are two societies meeting in Exeter Hall; the Sacred Harmonic Society, under the direction of Mr. Costa, and the one before mentioned. There were about one hundred and fifty members of the choir present at the meeting of the London Sacred Harmonic Society, with an accompaniment of about twenty stringed instruments. A new Anthem, by Dr. Elvey, of Windsor, was sung, and also Mozart’s Twelfth Mass. The performance was decidedly poor — vastly inferior to the German choruses which we have recently described. The time was tolerably well kept, but tune was far enough from accuracy. The same feeling about for the pitch, and uncertainty of tone, was observable in the more difficult modulations, which is so common with our untrained New England choirs; with this difference, however, that we occasionally stop to correct a badly-intoned passage, whereas here it was passed over as if unobserved, or as if such a dissonant performance had become a matter of habit. There was, too, an absence of all those things that go to make up a good choral performance, as Forte and Piano, Sforzando, Syncopated accent, distinctness and clearness of vocal utterance, &amp;c. The leader would occasionally sing out at the top of his voice, “Piano,” but he did not seem to expect that attention would be given to what he said, and kept on, under a press of sail, until another opportunity should occur for calling out with like result.
This was, indeed, a rehearsal; but if a choir is permitted to sing thus in rehearsal, will they not form habits that will prevent improvement, and will not the public performances be of the same general character?
The violins were badly played. One could hardly help coming to the conclusion that they were mostly beginners, assembled for practice. It would not be surprising to hear as bad, or even a worse, rehearsal, on the Western Continent; but, in Europe there should be, at least, a correct performance of the technicals of music, if not something belonging to the higher department of appropriate expression.",1852-08-Ee,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/249e970d5f9a49b3819d2da3de7c2e7f,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/9b6528671748a6865f819d1a77b240c5/1448395924450,Public Accompanied Indoor,http://musicbrainz.org/artist/f422b99a-b48c-4bee-bc0c-f2e8cad82b6c#_,Dr. Lowell Mason Lowell Mason,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Choir http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_music http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anthem

[…] when I was asked to play, I naturally began with the “Rondo Scherzando.” I wasn’t often nervous when I was asked to play in drawing-rooms, though I always hated having to perform a solo in public, in fact, I have always disliked public appearances, and the concerts I used sometimes to give myself always weighed on my mind like so many tons of lead till they were things of the past ! But on this occasion I felt a little excited, as if I were being put through my paces, for I realised that I must do my very best to live up to the musical reputation on which dear Mary Wakefield had almost risked her own. Her kind eyes shone with satisfaction as I played the last bars (the bars that sounded like a wink !) for she saw Mr. Lyttelton making his way up to the piano, evidently with the intention, to judge by the expression on his face, of making friends. And so he did. He beamed on me with that nice smile of his, and said something that put me very much at my ease.
“Do tell me,” he said quite eagerly, “who is the composer of that charming Rondo.

The performance of the Rheingold will live long in my memory, as the extreme realisation of weird beauty steeped in atmosphere such as may be in some other planet, flushed with sunset or moonrise. This music is like a land of dreams, into which the spirit breaks at times, and, hurrying back a million of years, discovers, on the surface of far-off seas, or dim caverns, the light that has long since gone out for ever. The elemental prelude of deep and slumbrous sound wafts us away from all account of time and space of the present. The vast hall, full of silent human beings, has been touched by the magician's wand. All grows dark, and the dim grey-green depths of the Rhine alone become visible. We strain our eyes into the dimness, and are aware of the deep moving of the Rhine water. The three Rhine daughters grow visible, swimming midwater, swimming and singing, guardians of the Rheingold. What unearthly, unhuman, magical, snatches of sweetest song!

The Germania held together about six years —most of the time in Boston. They made many short trips in New England, and one tournde with Jenny Lind. Their summers were profitably spent in Newport In the last two seasons they added as stars the famous girl violinist, Camille Urso, and Alfred Jaell, pianist Madame Urso is too well known to need any eulogy at my hands. She is one of the very few young wonders who developed into great artists at maturity. Jaell was a splendid pianist. If he were playing at the present day, he would bear comparison with the greatest living players. When the Germania disbanded, he went to Paris, made his home in that city, and won a popularity which he never lost. He died very recently.
The Germania were the first to play in Boston the C-Major Symphony of Schubert, the Ninth Symphony by Beethoven, and the Tannhauser overture.",184u-uu-uu,,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/3dc53dad014a7ee087374a53093598d4/1450196166943,Indoor Public Accompanied,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/Thomas+Ryan/1448997315048,Thomas Ryan,Performance,,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_music

I went over to Berlin in person to offer to the Countess my escort to London; and on Saturday, the 7th of July, this interesting debut took place, in Donizetti's ""Linda di Chamouni."" The Sontag once more trod those boards which had been the scene of her early triumphs. The sympathy her reappearance had created was evidenced by the enthusiastic, and it may be said, affectionate reception with which she was greeted by an overcrowded house. The cheering was universal, genuine, unusually prolonged. That she herself should be at first deeply affected, even to tears, at a greeting so heart-felt and spontaneous, was well conceivable. The revival of old memories, at those exciting and once familiar sounds, joined to the thought of the causes which had placed her in that arena, must have moved her pro- foundly. A glance at the box where sate the husband and children for whose sake this great and noble sacrifice had been made, gave her the necessary courage. Sontag subdued her emotion. In a few minutes she was once more the artist, and the artist alone. 
That a halo of interest was thrown around the high-placed lady, who had descended from her pedestal, and quitted the pride and charm of her social and domestic life to resume professional duties, long since laid aside, was perfectly intelligible. But it was not as the heroine of a romance of real life that Sontag reappeared; not as the Countess, who from well-appreciated motives had reassumed the dramatic mantle. It was as the artist alone that she had come to earn the suffrages of the public — as the artist alone that she desired to be judged. It was to sound judgment, and not to mere curiosity and sympathy, however legitimately awakened, that she appealed. And in that judgment she found her reward. Her return to the stage was one long triumph. 
All had felt that it must be a marvel, if, after more than twenty years, this gifted prima donna could return with her powers unimpaired. Yet the marvel was here — an unquestionable fact. Her voice was ""as fresh, pure, and beautiful as ever."" Madame Sontag brought back an artistic skill, matured and perfected by the continued study which, since her retirement, had been to her a labour of love. The beauty, which had exercised so great a fascination over an elder generation, was, strange to say, but little changed. It was remodelled rather than effaced, whilst the figure seemed almost untouched by time. The pleasing contour of the face, the beaming and expressive eye, and, above all, the winning smile which formerly had stolen away so many hearts, were all there. Men declared that with the most clear and searching of opera- glasses they could not give her more than five-and-twenty. She was, in truth, a living marvel! And, more strange than all, the Sontag who had been deemed by a former' generation somewhat deficient as an actress (although the most exquisite of soprano singers), was discovered to have warmth, animation, expression, even power, as a dramatic artist! The fascination of her histrionic talent came to be as great as that of her faultless execution. The public is said to be a ""wayward"" creature; but, on the contrary, it is extremely difficult to be moved from prepossessions once formed for good or for evil. Whatever change may supervene in an artist, the public is loath to admit a change into its own formed opinions. Sontag left the stage with the reputation of being ""no actress."" On her return, it was almost impossible to persuade this public, wedded to traditions, that she was (what really was the case) one of the most finished and exquisite histrionic artists.",http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/day/1849-07-07,,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/e175b188bc7e1fdad28c6dd6b59a839c/1438778107964,Indoor Public Accompanied,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Benjamin+Lumley/1438607277398,Benjamin Lumley,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

A principal point of attraction is always found in the Symphony, and on this occasion it was not a Mozart, a Beethoven, or a Mendelssohn, but an original manuscript composition of a member of the Orchestra, Ferd. Hermann, that was performed. Herr Hermann directed his own Symphony. It did not meet with a very warm reception, though sufficiently so to afford good encouragement to the author and his friends. There is always so much caution and incredulity, and sometimes suspicion, envy and jealousy abroad, that the path to&nbsp;fame, even to true merit, is rough and beset with difficulties.
Our author, we suppose, could not complain of the manner in which his work was received, and probably a young composer does not often obtain greater approbation. There were undoubtedly fine points in the Symphony, indicating talent, taste and judgment. Its themes were concise and clear, and there seemed to be a considerable degree of the effusion of genuine feeling, without dry detail, commonplace thoughts, or tedious repetitions. The instrumentation was quite well balanced, though the Oboe was, perhaps, somewhat too prominent in the melodic passages; a greater variety of coloring in this respect might be an improvement. The thoughts were easy, natural and chaste, but yet never so striking as to call forth a rapturous or involuntary exclamation of delight or applause. The interest too was well sustained through the four movements, and although we suppose that the critics will not allow to this Symphony a higher place than mediocrity, yet the young author may be well contented with the award bestowed, return to his study, and try again.
Signor Stigelli, a Tenor, from the Royal Italian Opera, London, sang with approbation; Carl Deichmann, a Violinist, from Hanover, played with entire success, a Concerto, by Vieux Temps; an aria by Julius Rietz, (Conductor,) was charmingly sung by Miss Mayer, coming seemingly fresh from the heart, on the tones of a sweet voice.

Both Jean de Reszke and Lassalle had been working hard at their parts all through the winter &nbsp;&nbsp;and spring. Toward the end they received valuable assistance in their studies from the veteran maestro al piano, Herr Saar, a well-known figure &nbsp;at Covent Garden for upward of a quarter of a century. This excellent musician— a genuine type &nbsp;of the old German school— was the conductor at Strasburg, and familiar with every note of Wagner's scores. He shared my intense enthusiasm &nbsp;&nbsp;on the subject of Jean de Reszke's &nbsp;“predestination'' for the great Wagner roles, and his joy over the approaching advent of the new Walther von Stolzing knew no bounds. I was often present when he came round to the Continental to do a morning's work with the great tenor. His good-humored face would be wreathed in smiles as he sat down to the piano; and when Jean sang the&nbsp;""Probelieder"" or the ''Preislied,"" with a charm &nbsp;that gave them a new meaning, the old accompanist would gaze heavenward through his spectacles with a look of ecstasy that was far more eloquent than words. He objected to the cuts; he cordially disliked the Italian text; but he was aware that both were indispensable, and he had the satisfaction of knowing that we all agreed with him.

Here let me refer, par parenthese, to the English debut of Edouard de Reszke. That event properly belongs to 1880, when he appeared for the first time at Covent Garden as Indra in ”Le Roi de Lahore”.

Thus, amidst unusual discussion, turmoil, and agitation, the season of 1847 at length commenced on Tuesday, the 16th February, with Donizetti's opera, ""La Favorita,"" and an entirely new ballet, composed by Paul Taglioni, under the title of ""Coralia."" ""LaFavorita,"" although not entirely new to England, having been already performed at London both in French and English, was new to the Italian boards; and in its Italian form had all the interest of a novelty. Perhaps, thus given as it was with singers far superior to any heard in it in this country, and with a far more correct and powerful ensemble, the opera gained in popular favour rather than lost, through the familiarity of opera-goers with its melodies. Apart from the unwonted interest attached by all the friends and habitues of the long-cherished establishment, to the opening of Her Majesty's Theatre in face of the new opposition, considerable sensation was excited by the first appearance on the Anglo-Italian stage of Signor Gardoni. Much had been said of the strange adventures that had befallen the handsome and gentlemanlike young tenor during his brief musical career. His first appearance on the stage raised a battery of opera-glasses from every part of the house; a murmur of gratified expectation followed. The success of Gardoni on this occasion was undoubted. Both his principal solos, sung in the purest taste and with perfect feeling, were encored with enthusiasm. The attraction of his performance was felt by all. Voice, style, and expression were there. His talent as an actor was alone disputed; for these were already days when a singer, however great his merit as a vocalist, was expected (and justly, on the lyrical stage) to be a histrionic artist also. It became the fashion among some dilettanti to say that Gardoni was no actor. Still, even as an actor he was pleasing. His manner, his bearing, his feeling, his conception of parts were blameless. He lacked only one element — power; he was not capable of bursts of passion.",http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/day/1847-02-16,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Her_Majesty's_Theatre,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/9536aacef91fa46c1a38130b74d0d47d/1438686831228,Accompanied Public Indoor,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Benjamin+Lumley/1438607277398,Benjamin Lumley,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

Mr. John S. Dwight, the then accomplished editor and critic of the Commonwealth, gives the following account of the affair:
“THE MENDELSSOHN COMMEMORATION
“ The musical event of the season, at least so far as sentiment, artistic unity, and completeness, selectness, and novelty may be regarded, came off, in a way that more than realized expectation, at the Melodeon on Monday night. It was a pure festival of art a beautiful, sincere German enthusiasm inspired it and adorned it. The Quintette Club, prompted by the sentiment of the occasion, had sent free tickets to the three hundred or more subscribers to their chamber concerts. But almost thrice that number, at an early hour, were seated in the hall, which had been tastefully and significantly decorated. In large letters of evergreen the name * Mendelssohn ’ was displayed upon the front of the gallery, over the entrance, and on either side ‘ Born Feb. 3, 1809,’ and * Died in 1847/ In the centre of the circle, focus of all eyes and of all thoughts,—that is, in the front of the stage, before the organ,—that spot so often occupied by vain and showy solo players who seemed to place themselves before all music,—now rose the calm, pure, classic head of the true genius of the hour, a beautiful bust of Mendelssohn, crowned with laurel. We confess our thoughts were riveted to that intellectual, that unspeakably beautiful and expressive face, in whose fine and noble features one felt the union of a masculine dignity and firmness with almost a woman’s feeling. And then the large, clear, exquisitely moulded dome of thought, the perfect forehead! To tell the feelings that rushed through the mind and filled it all that evening, would require more than our power of expression. It should be a poem.
“ But the effect was first complete when the five young artists, with their instruments, had seated themselves around their patron saint, to interpret to us one of his quintettes. Then as the music, his own music, woke, the calm face elevated in the middle of the group seemed almost to open its eyes and move its lips; and who did not feel the music and the marble to be mutual interpreters, and that the great composer was thus doubly present to us ! The sentiment of the thing was so complete that the mind involuntarily hugged the spell; and any voice of conversation, even when a strain was finished, seemed an interruption.”",http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/day/1851-02-03,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boston,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/9b131394ecf6b3bae85ad2279b80d005/1450267411411,Indoor Public Accompanied,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/agent/John+S+Dwight/1450266526136,John S Dwight,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chamber_orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chamber_music

Hans Richter was wont to declare that Edward Lloyd was the first tenor to bring out in all its fascinating loveliness the exquisite vocal charm of the “Preislied”.

Shortly after Easter appeared Mademoiselle Parodi, the favourite pupil and friend of the great Pasta. Upon her, it was said, the mantle of the illustrious prima donna had descended. Pasta herself had declared that, in the person of this object of her solicitude and her future hopes, she herself was to rise again before the world. These sentiments were repeated by Madame Pasta in a letter to me, in which she recommended “la mia Teresa"" to my care. The delight of the now aged prima donna in seeing herself revived in her favourite pupil, is apparent in every phrase. She writes: ""Plena di riconoscenza;"" and, in the fulness of her heart, exclaims, ""Oh! beata I'lnghilterra! Che Dio la renda sempra piu felice!"" The zealous and eager sympathy of the instructress with the pupil was unbounded. Mademoiselle Parodi appeared in one of the most favourite and celebrated characters of la Pasta, although the choice of this role de debut was bold and even dangerous. As has been seen in the quasi failure of Jenny Lind herself, the most popular and most adored of all prime donne of the time, in the part of Norma, it was impossible even for the most petted of pets to dare to undertake the task of rivalry, even in seeming, with the one who had been so long associated in English estimation with the true ideal of the Druid Priestess. Of all Madame Grisi's parts, Norma was the one in which no effort of rivalry was to be endured. The success of Mademoiselle Parodi, however, on her first debut, was in appearance very great. Moulded as her whole style, both as singer and actress, were upon her great prototype, she gave to a new generation an idea of the ""Pasta"" of their fathers; and, with old opera-goers, revived in some degree the memories of the past. Her voice was full and melodious, but "" veiled,"" like that of her instructress, in its upper notes. Her acting was distinguished, as had been that of the Siddons of the operatic stage, by simple grandeur, rather than by fiery impulse. Her success, as has been said, was great on her appearance; but no evening of triumph filled the void left in the hearts of the public by the seclusion of Jenny Lind.",1849-uu-uu,,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/574cc7b414ce1c289d7e5ee2dbd5677c/1438770589624,Indoor Public Accompanied,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Benjamin+Lumley/1438607277398,Benjamin Lumley,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera

I was at this time about sixteen and a member of the Brighton Symphony Society. We played the symphonies of the old masters to not very critical audiences in the Pavilion, and I have also played in the Brighton Town Hall. It was at these meetings I first fell in with OURY. I noticed a little group in the ante-room on one of the rehearsal nights; they were chattering round a thickset crotchety-looking little man and trying to persuade him to do something. He held his fiddle, but would not easily yield to their entreaties. They were asking him to play. At last he raised his Cremona to his chin and began to improvise. What fancy and delicacy and execution! what refinement! His peculiar gift lay not only in a full round tone, but in the musical"" embroideries ""the long flourishes, the torrents of multitudinous notes ranging all over the instrument. I can liken those astonishing violin passages to nothing but the elaborate embroidery of little notes which in CHOPIN'S music are spangled in tiny type all round the subject, which is in large type. When OURY was in a good humour he would gratify us in this way, and then stop abruptly, and nothing after that would induce him to play another note.",185u-uu-uu,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/place/6dfa5caf994ab227d21a976da4ffee4a,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/b2c50a7f9d6cb67f9cd2189886290065/1437671562910,Domestic Accompanied Indoor,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hugh_Reginald_Haweis,Hugh Reginald Haweis,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Violin,

And now let me visit the well- known Church of S. Thomas, close at hand, where Bach played the organ and produced most of those deathless compositions, notably the “ Matthias Passionsmusik,” which have made his name immortal, and placed him on the highest pinnacle of excellence [...]
Just after leaving the Church, a troop of Prussian infantry overtook us, and though it was mid-day, with a broiling July sun, they were marching at remarkably quick pace. […]Proceeding with them for a short distance, when they halted at the old castle, we saw that three of their number instantaneously dropped down in a state of insensibility, but were immediately carried off to the castle by their fellows.

A precentor, standing in front of the pulpit, led the singing. He first read a stanza, and then it was sung by all the people; and, thus, the whole hymn was alternately read and sung. The same obstacle to success in Congregational singing was observable here, as at the Scotch Church in the morning — the tunes were too difficult, and the effect of the singing was wretched.

The Pastor Wunsche and the Deacon Stobwasser had in the kindest manner invited me, and they received me on entering with much warmth. Count Groben met me on leaving the carriage, with the intelligence that I was to dine to-day with the King at Charlottenburg—and then the Master of the Household communicated the same, with the addition that my son was invited with me (an unusual distinction). Then we were directed to the seats on the King's left hand — the lowest of which I took, and George sat behind me. Presently an old man rose and stretched out his hand to me, with a kind look—it was Goschel, Schmieder's friend ; then came Krummacher and others ; at length the King entered (without the Queen) ; and an ancient hymn of the Bohemian Brethren (similar to that beginning, ' The Church of Christ ') was sung, with trombone-accompaniment.",http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/day/1857-09-26,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Berlin,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/http://data.open.ac.uk/led/music/Ancient+Hymn+of+the+Bohemian+Brethren/1434374547895/1434374547908,Accompanied Indoor,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/The+King+of+Prussia/1434374365751 http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Deacon+Stobwasser/1434374425911 http://dbpedia.org/resource/Christian_Charles_Josias_von_Bunsen http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Krummacher/1434374478035 http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Pastor+Wunsche/1434374416840 http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Clergy+of+Berlin/1434374389971 http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Goschel/1434374463556 http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Count+Groben/1434374441185 http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/George+Bunsen/1434374345998,"The King of Prussia Deacon Stobwasser Christian Charles Josias, Baron von Bunsen Baron von Bunsen Christian Karl Josias von Bunsen Christian Charles Josias von Bunsen Krummacher Pastor Wunsche Clergy of Berlin Goschel Count Groben George Bunsen",Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trombone http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_voice,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vocal_music http://dbpedia.org/resource/Religious_music http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hymn

Their summers were profitably spent in Newport In the last two seasons they added as stars the famous girl violinist, Camille Urso, and Alfred Jaell, pianist Madame Urso is too well known to need any eulogy at my hands. She is one of the very few young wonders who developed into great artists at maturity. Jaell was a splendid pianist. If he were playing at the present day, he would bear comparison with the greatest living players. When the Germania disbanded, he went to Paris, made his home in that city, and won a popularity which he never lost. He died very recently.

Sullivan wrote “Ivanhoe,"" so to speak, with &nbsp;his life-blood. He slaved at it steadily from May till December, and put into it only of his best. &nbsp;For weeks before he finished it he was inaccessible; the Christmas of 1890 was no holiday for &nbsp;him. The rehearsals had begun long before the &nbsp;orchestration was ready, and the opera was to &nbsp;be produced on January 31, 1891, at the latest. &nbsp;By the first week in the new year the score was &nbsp;completed. Then Sir Arthur told me I might come to Queen's Mansions to hear some of the music. &nbsp;To my great delight, he played several of the numbers for me. I found them picturesque, dramatic, original, and stamped throughout with the &nbsp;cachet which the world understands by the word “Sullivanesque”. I was particularly struck by&nbsp;the Oriental character of the harmonies and “intervals” in Rebecca's song, “Lord of our chosen&nbsp;race,"" and I told Sullivan that I thought nothing&nbsp;could be more distinctively Eastern or even Hebraic in type. &nbsp;&nbsp;
“That may well be so,"" he rejoined. “The&nbsp;phrase on the words 'guard me' you especially refer to is not strictly mine. Let me tell you where &nbsp;I heard it. Wlien I was the 'Mendelssohn scholar'&nbsp;and living at Leipsic, I went once or twice to the &nbsp;old Jewish synagogue, and among the many Eastern melodies chanted by the minister, this quaint&nbsp;progression in the minor occurred so frequently &nbsp;that I have never forgotten it”.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The charming ballet, ""Giselle,"" with the truly captivating music of Adolphe Adam, was produced on the opening night of 1842. Carlotta Grisi, not absolutely unknown here, but now entitled for the first time to touch the highest position, and her clever, agile husband, Perrot, were the prominent artists in the entertainment. A Mademoiselle Fleury, new to England, added to the excellent effect of the ensemble as the Queen of the Wilis. The anti-pantomimic malcontents not having yet assumed the position of a fashionable faction, the ""story"" was admitted to be ""vastly pretty."" ""Giselle"" was pronounced a success, and the production of this ballet may be regarded as the main element of attraction on the opening of my first season. Its success was probably owing to the fact of the whole story being comprised within the limits of a short romantic legend, which, in the hands of a skilful ""Mime,"" becomes easily intelligible.",1842-uu-uu,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Her_Majesty's_Theatre,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/performance/4dc171b96a134c2205a445c7cd8386a3/1438607936753,Public Indoor Accompanied,http://data.open.ac.uk/led/person/Benjamin+Lumley/1438607277398,Benjamin Lumley,Performance,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ballet_(music)

On the next day I had the pleasure of spending a few delightful musical hours at the house of my friend, where I had the opportunity of seeing and hearing what German amateurs can accomplish, and what an interest they take in the practice and cultivation of music in its highest and most enjoyable form. The family assembled in a large room, denuded of its carpet, that the musical sounds might be heard to greater advantage. Our host being an accomplished violinist, and each member of his family playing some stringed instrument, there was here material for the performance of much excellent chamber music. First we had a classical overture, arranged as a duet for the pianoforte and a string quartet; then a violin solo, one of those charming romances by the old Italian masters, lately reprinted in Leipzig ; then a Trio of Beethoven’s, for pianoforte, violin, and violoncello ; then some vocal music, and for a finale, another overture arranged as the first.
